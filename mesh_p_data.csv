SHE STATES THAT SHE DEVELOPED STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE 2 YEARS AGO FOLLOWING HER 2ND VAGINAL DELIVERY. SHE HAS INCONTINENCE WITH COUGH, SNEEZE, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS OCCASIONAL URGENCY, BUT NO URGE INCONTINENCE. SHE UNDERWENT A MONARC OBTURATOR SLING WITH PERIGEE ANTERIOR COLPORRHAPHY, RECTOCELE REPAIR, AND HYSTERECTOMY IN 2006. POSTOPERATIVELY, SHE CONTINUED TO HAVE WHAT SHE DESCRIBED AS MINOR INCONTINENCE OR VAGINAL DISCHARGE THAT SLOWLY PROGRESSED TO DEFINITE URINARY INCONTINENCE. SHE IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING FREQUENCY WITH A SENSATION OF INCOMPLETE EMPTYING AND INCONTINENCE WITH COUGH AND SNEEZE. ON OCCASION, SHE HAS HAD DRIBBLING AND URGE INCONTINENCE AS WELL. SHE IS CURRENTLY USING 5 TO 6 PANTY LINERS DAILY. THERE ARE NOT SATURATED AT THE TIME OF CHANGE. SHE ALSO DESCRIBES CHRONIC VULVAR IRRITATION. S HE HAS BEEN AVOIDING INTERCOURSE SINCE SURGERY BECAUSE OF THIS VULVAR IRRITATION AND THE SENSATION AS THOUGH HE IS HITTING SOMETHING DURING INTERCOURSE. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: INFECTED VAGINAL MESH, PERIGEE TYPE, WITH A LARGE CENTRAL ABSCESS CAVITY AND REACTION IN THE VAGINAL WALL OVERLYING THE ABSCESS CAVITY, RESULTING IN A LARGE 5-CM IN DIAMETER MASS LESION. OPERATION PERFORMED: INCISION AND DRAINAGE OF DEEP VAGINAL ABSCESS, REMOVAL OF FOREIGN MATERIAL, NAMELY WOVEN POLYPROPYLENE MESH FROM THE DEEP PART OF THE VAGINA WHERE IT CONSTITUTED AN INFECTIOUS NIDUS ALL THE WAY UP TO THE OBTURATOR FORAMEN ON BOTH SIDES. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: THIS PATIENT WAS ORIGINALLY SEEN BY DR. WHO FOUND AN ENLARGED VAGINAL MASS FOLLOWING A PERIGEE AND TOT PROCEDURE. THE PATIENT HAD CYSTOSCOPY AT THAT TIME AND THE TOT, AND THE PERIGEE DID NOT INVOLVE THE BLADDER ITSELF OR THE URETHRA. I SAW HER IN CONSULTATION AND DECIDED THAT THE ONLY PRACTICABLE METHOD OF TREATMENT HERE WOULD BE TO REMOVE THE MESH. THE PATIENT HAD INTERMITTENT VAGINAL BLEEDING AND DISCHARGE RELATED TO THE INFECTION, AND WE TOLD HER THAT WE WOULD BE AS AGGRESSIVE AS POSSIBLE AND TO REMOVE AS MUCH OF THE MESH AS POSSIBLE. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: THERE WAS A LARGE VAGINAL MASS WITH HYPERTROPHIC AND EDEMATOUS VAGINAL EPITHELIUM WHICH WAS SEPARATE FROM THE VAGINAL AREA UNDERLYING THE URETHRA. THAT PART WAS NORMAL. THIS IS WHERE ONE WOULD EXPECT A CYSTOCELE TO BE, BUT IT WAS A LARGE MASS. DEEP TO THE MASS WAS AN ABSCESS CAVITY WHICH DRAINED FAIRLY FOUL-SMELLING PURULENT MATERIAL, AND DEEP TO THAT WAS WOVEN MESH, A LOT OF WOVEN MESH, WITH PROLENE SUTURES. WE REMOVED EVERY BIT OF THE PROLENE MESH AND PROLENE SUTURES THAT WE COULD REMOVE RIGHT UP TO THE OBTURATOR FOSSA. PROCEDURE: THE PATIENT WAS ANESTHETIZED WITH GENERAL LARYNGEAL MASK ANESTHESIA, AND SHE WAS THEN PLACED IN THE LITHOTOMY POSITION ON THE OR TABLE WITH HER FEET IN CANDY-CANE STIRRUPS. A CAREFUL PREP AND DRAPE WERE DONE USING BETADINE, AND THE VAGINAL RETRACTOR WAS PLACED. AN 18 FOLEY CATHETER WAS PLACED, AND WE INSPECTED THE ANTERIOR VAGINAL WALL. THE URETHRA WAS IN NORMAL POSITION AND FELT NORMAL AS DID THE VAGINA OVERLYING THE URETHRA. ONE GOT THE IMPRESSION OF THE TOT TAPE AS IT COURSE UNDERNEATH THE URETHRA, BUT THAT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE INVOLVED IN THE INFLAMMATORY PROCESS THAT WAS IN THE DEEPER AREA OF THE VAGINA. WITH ALLIS CLAMPS, WE GRASPED THE PROTRUDING AREA OF THE VAGINA AND OPENED IT WITH A 15 BLADE. CONTINUING DOWN, CUTTING VERY CAREFULLY UNDER DIRECT VISION, WE CAME UPON AN ABSCESS CAVITY WHICH WE OPENED AND DRAINED. THE MATERIAL IN THE ABSCESS CAVITY WAS FOUL SMELLING. IN THE DEPTHS OF THE ABSCESS CAVITY ALONG THE WALL OF THE BLADDER WAS MESH, A LOT OF MESH. WE TRANSECTED THE MESH IN THE MIDLINE AND TOOK OUT THE RIGHT AND LEFT HALVES AND THE ARMS OF THE PERIGEE WHICH WENT INTO THE OBTURATOR FOSSA. WE WENT UP AS FAR AS WE COULD, RIGHT ON THE BONE, RIGHT AS THE MESH DISAPPEARED IN THE OBTURATOR FOSSA, AND REMOVED ALL THAT MESH AND ALL THE SUTURE MATERIAL. THIS WAS A FAIRLY TEDIOUS DISSECTION, BUT NO TRAUMA WAS INCURRED TO THE BLADDER OR URETHRA. BLEEDING WAS MINIMAL. WE THEN COPIOUSLY IRRIGATED THE CAVITY WHICH WAS A LARGE OPEN CAVITY NOW. WE GENTLY CLOSED THE EDGES OF THE CAVITY WITH 3-0 PDS AND PACKED WITH IODOFORM GAUZE. THIS WOUND IS GOING TO HAVE TO GRANULATE FROM INSIDE-OUT AND WE CANNOT ALLOW THE OUTSIDE EDGE OF THE WOUND TO CLOSE BECAUSE THAT WILL TRAP INFECTED MATERIAL INT THE DEPTHS OF THE WOUND. THE ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS WAS LESS THAN 30 ML. THE PATIENT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL. WE THEN TOOK THE PATIENT OUT OF THE LITHOTOMY POSITION, PUT HER SUPINE ON THE OR TABLE.

THE ANTERIOR WALL WAS INFILTRATED WITH 7 ML OF PITRESSIN SOLUTION, 20 UNITS, AND 50 ML OF NORMAL SALINE. THE MESH WAS GRASPED WITH SHARP AND BLUNT DISSECTION. THE MESH WAS FREED WITH DIFFICULTY FROM ANTERIOR VAGINAL WALL TO THE LEVEL OF THE OBTURATOR INTERNUS MUSCLES BILATERALLY. THE MESH WAS THEN EXCISED. PALPATION SHOWED REALLY NO MESH PALPABLE ON THE PT'S RIGHT SIDE. THE ARM OF THE MESH WAS PALPATED ON THE LEFT SIDE AGAIN WHERE IT APPEARS THROUGH THE OBTURATOR INTERNUS MUSCLE FAR FROM THE MIDLINE VAGINAL INCISION. AT THIS TIME, CYSTOSCOPY WAS PERFORMED WHICH WAS NORMAL. THE 2ND TEAM MADE A LOW TRANSVERSE INCISION ABDOMINALLY AND HARVESTED A 2 X 8-CM FASCIAL GRAFT. THIS WAS TAGGED ON EACH END WITH 2-0 PDS VAGINALLY. THE PERIURETHRAL AREA WAS DISSECTED, AND THE SPACE OF RETZIUS WAS ENTERED. WITH THE USE OF MCGUIRE NEEDLE PASSERS, THE SLING WAS PLACED. IT WAS TAGGED TO THE MIDLINE AT THE URETHROVESICAL JUNCTION WITH 3-0 VICRYL. FOLLOWING IRRIGATION, THE ANTERIOR VAGINAL WALL WAS THEN CLOSED WITH A RUNNING 2-0 VICRYL. THE ABDOMINAL INCISION FASCIA WAS CLOSED WITH A 0 PDS. THE SLING WAS THEN TIED OVER THE MIDLINE WITH A 2-CM GAP FOR LOOSE PLACEMENT. THE SUBCUTANEOUS FAT WAS IRRIGATED. THE SKIN WAS CLOSED WITH 4-0 MONOCRYL. A TRANSURETHRAL FOLEY WAS LEFT IN SITU. FOLLOWING PLACEMENT OF THE SLING, A 3RD CYSTOSCOPY WAS PERFORMED WHICH AGAIN SHOWED BOTH URETERS TO EFFLUX AND NO FOREIGN BODY IN THE BLADDER. A TRANSURETHRAL FOLEY WAS THEN REPLACED.

BEFORE THE SURGERY, I HAD NEVER LEAKED, I HAD ENJOYED RELATIONS WITH MY HUSBAND AND LIFE WAS GOOD. SINCE THE SURGERY, NOT A DAY GOES BY THAT I DO NOT EXPERIENCE CONSTANT PELVIC PAIN, I CONTINUALLY LEAK, AND MARITAL RELATIONS ARE BLEAK IF AT ALL AND VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN EXPERIENCED. WHEN I WENT BACK TO MY SURGEON AFTER THE PROCEDURE COMPLAINING OF LEAKAGE AND PAIN, I WAS BASICALLY IGNORED. I WAS QUICKLY REFERRED TO ANOTHER DOCTOR. SUPPOSEDLY MY PROBLEMS WERE NOT THE MESH OR THE SURGERY, BUT OBVIOUSLY I NOW SUDDENLY HAD SERIOUS UROLOGICAL PROBLEMS. THE FIRST UROLOGIST RAKED AS MUCH AS SHE COULD FROM MY INSURANCE COMPANY WITH UNNECESSARY TESTS AND WHEN THERE WERE NO MORE TESTS THAT SHE COULD ADVISE ME WERE NECESSARY, I WAS PASSED OFF TO A THIRD UROLOGIST. THE THIRD UROLOGIST IMMEDIATELY STATED THAT THE MESH WAS A MESS AND I NEEDED IMMEDIATE CLEAN UP SURGERY FROM THE HANGING ENDS THAT WERE CAUSING THE LEAKAGE AND THE PAIN. OF COURSE, AT THIS POINT I WAS WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING SO I UNDERWENT YET ANOTHER MAJOR SURGERY AT MORE EXPENSE, MORE TIME AWAY FROM MY JOB, LOSS OF MORE TIME, MONEY ETC., BUT TO NO AVAIL. AFTER THAT HE RECOMMENDED DRUGS; AFTER TRYING THREE MAJOR INCONTINENCE DRUGS, I STILL LEAKED. I HAD HORRID HEADACHES AND THE PAIN AND MISERY WAS STILL THERE. SO I DECIDED NO MORE DRUGS, WHAT IS NEXT. HE THEN SUGGESTED YET ANOTHER VERY PAINFUL SURGERY, IN THE OFFICE. I TRIED THAT AND TO DATE; I STILL LEAK. I STILL CAN NOT HAVE RELATIONS AND I AM MISERABLE. I HAVE LOST A LOT OF TIME, MONEY AND HAVE HAD MAJOR STRESS OVER THIS LITTLE PIECE OF PROLENE MESH USED IN A GYNECARE TVT BLADDER SUSPENSION SURGERY. AFTER I RETURNED HOME FROM THE SECOND SURGERY TO REPAIR ""HANGING MESH"" / WHERE I AGAIN UNDERWENT ANESTHESIA AND MORE HUMILIATION. I FOUND OUT THAT THIS MESH HAS HAD MAJOR PROBLEMS AND SHOULD PROBABLY BE PULLED OFF THE MARKET. BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN IT IS INSIDE OF YOU, GROWING IN YOU, LEAVING YOU MISERABLE/PULL OUT YOUR INSIDES. I HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR ME, BUT MAYBE YOU CAN STOP OTHER WOMEN FROM LIVING A LIFE OF MISERY.",,,,1.0,2008/01/31,GYNECARE PROLENE MESH,MESH,JOHNSON AND JOHNSON,*,,*,,,,*,,0,,*,*,*,*,,,FTL,,,,,

I WAS DIAGNOSED LAST YEAR WITH CYSTOCELE. I HAD A COMPLETE HYSTERECTOMY AND A BLADDER SUSPENSION SURGERY -TVH. I HEALED RATHER WELL FROM THIS SURGERY AND BASICALLY DID PRETTY WELL WITH THIS SURGERY. I HAD AN OUTPATIENT SURGERY AND WAS HOME IN 4 HOURS WITH A CATHETER IN ME. YES..HOME IN 4 HOURS. THEN, I STARTED HAVING SYMPTOMS AGAIN, MEANING FREQUENT URINATION, DIFFICULT FOR BM'S, AND BASICALLY, NOW MY BLADDER AND RECTUM WERE FALLING OUT OF MY VAGINA. UNFORTUNATELY, I HAD A BROTHER PASS AWAY IN JUNE AND UNBENOUNCED TO US, MY SISTER, -YES, MY MOTHER'S FIRST BORN DAUGHTER-, CHANGED HIS BENEFICIARY TO HERSELF WHILE HE WAS TOTALLY INCOMPETENT- HE PASSED AWAY, BUT HE HAD A RESUSCITATION ORDER AND WAS REVIVED. HE WAS A JUVENILE DIABETIC. FROM THE MOMENT HE WENT INTO THE HOSPITAL, HE HAD A SUGAR LEVEL OF 10. MY SISTER ONLY TOLD US - A LOT OF THE FAMILY 6 OTHERS OF US LIVE IN ANOTHER STATE-, THAT HE WAS IN INTENSIVE CARE. MY OTHER SISTER WENT UP TO THE HOSPITAL TO FIND OUT HOW HE WAS DOING AND MY SISTER WOULDN'T LET MY SISTER IN. HE WAS IN THE TRAUMA UNIT ON MASSIVE EQUIPMENT BECAUSE HE WAS ON LIFE SUPPORT. MY BROTHER MARRIED TWICE AND ONLY HAD HIS BENEFICIARY AS MY MOTHER & FATHER AND WHEN MY FATHER PASSED AWAY, 6 DAYS LATER HE CHANGED IT TO MY MOTHER. THIRTY FOUR YEARS OF BEING THE BENEFICIARY AND NOW WE ARE IN A LAWSUIT. ANYWAY, I STATE THIS, BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN TAKING CARE OF THIS ISSUE RATHER THAN TAKING CARE OF MYSELF. SO, COME END OF AUGUST, IT WAS TIME TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. I HAD THE CYSTOCELE AND RECTOCELE SURGERY. IT HAS NOW BEEN 4 WEEKS AND I HAVE BEEN ON BED REST BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN BLEEDING TO THE POINT, I BECAME ANEMIC. I HAVE BEEN TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE ON A WEEKLY BASIS, BECAUSE HE SAYS I HAVE ""A RAW SPOT THAT IS NOT HEALING"". HE CAUTERIZES ME AND SENDS ME HOME. WELL, TODAY, I HAD SURGERY IN THE OFFICE. YES, SURGERY. HE NUMBS MY INSIDES, AND PROBES AND PRODDED ME AND THEN DECIDES THAT IT WOULD BE BEST THAT WE STITCH THE AREA THAT IT NOT HEALING. WITH 2 NURSES HOLDING ME AND HIM DOING THE STITCHING. HE ADMITTED HE ""DIDN'T DO THE STITCHING PROPERLY-. I WAS SHAKING SO BAD AND HE SAW THAT. I ASKED HIM IF I NEEDED PAIN MEDS... HE SAID ""NO"". WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO RISK THE FACT OF ANY PAIN ANYMORE... SO FORTUNATELY FROM THE SURGERY, I HAVE 2 HYDROCODONES LEFT. HERE I HAVE BEE SET BACK AGAIN. I HAVE BEEN ON BED REST FOR 4 WEEKS... I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS ANYMORE, AND THEN I'M LEAVING THE OFFICE, THE RECEPTIONIST SAYS I HAVE AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE. EXCUSE ME, WE HAD TO PAY MY DOCTOR BEFORE I HAD THE SURGERY. I TOLD HER I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BILL AND LET MY HUSBAND TO LOOK AT IT. I PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE MY HUSBAND TO HAND THIS BILL TO THIS DOCTOR AND SAY ""YOU PAY IT"". THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE LOVE TO HUSBAND AND PROBABLY WON'T FOR ANOTHER 4-6 WEEKS. MY DOCTOR HAS BEEN TELLING ME ""YOUR SUCH A GOOD TROUPER"", ""YOUR EMOTIONAL HANDLING THIS WELL, AND WOW, I CANT BELIEVE THAT DIDN'T HURT. I'M NOT THE KIND OF PERSON TO SAY THIS KIND OF STUFF AND TO BE WRITING THIS IS ANOTHER THING TOO. BY THE WAY- HE ALSO PINCHED MY LABIA WHILE HE WAS DOING THE STITCHING. I YELLED OUCH, AND THEN HE TOLD ME SORRY. UPDATE: ""SURGERY IN THE OFFICE"" WELL, AFTER I HAD THIS ""SURGERY IN THE OFFICE"", I DEVELOPED HIVES. I WAS PUT ON PREDNISONE AND HYDROXYL... BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE THE DOSAGE RIGHT... SO I WAS DYING WITH THE ITCHES. I SPENT 4 DAYS NOT SLEEPING AND FEELING MISERABLE. I FINALLY DECIDED TO GO TO ER AND FIND OUT WHAT COULD BE DONE. THEY SAID YOU NEED TO BE PUT ON PREDNISONE AGAIN AND HYDROXYL-ATARAX-FOR THE ANXIETY. I HAD MY SURGERY SEPT 2 AND NOW MY DOCTOR TELLS ME THAT I SHOULD GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR, SO HE SETS ME UP WITH A UROGYNECOLOGIST TO FIND OUT THAT I AM HAVING MESH EROSION. NEVER DID HE MENTION THIS TO ME AT ALL. HE JUST WOULD SAY ""I'M NOT HEALING PROPERLY"". DOESN'T HE THINK I COULD UNDERSTAND OR CHECK OUT WHAT A MESH EROSION IS? TODAY, I STILL HAVE THE HIVES AND STILL DEAL WITH THAT ON A DAILY BASIS. BENADRYL AND HYDROXYL IS WHAT IM STILL TAKING. I AM RESCHEDULE FOR SURGERY, WHICH MEANS AGAIN 4-6 WEEKS RECOVERY.

I WAS TOLD I WOULD NEED ANOTHER HERNIA/MESH REPAIR. MY DIAGNOSES AT THE TIME WAS ""RECURRENT INCISIONAL VENTRAL HERNIA AND INTESTINAL ADHESIONS. TWO DAYS AFTER, A NEW MESH WAS PLACED IN AND OLD ONE REMOVED, I COMPLAINED TO MY SURGEON I DIDN'T FEEL WELL. I COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT; I JUST HAD SUCH A HARD TIME MOVING, COUGHING, SNEEZING, AND JUST WALKING. HE ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD NEED LOTS OF MONTHS TO RECOVER. UPON MY RELEASE, MY HUSBAND EVEN DEMANDED TO THE HEAD NURSE THAT I NEEDED TO STAY LONGER, BUT SHE SAID MY TIME WAS UP AND NOTHING SHOWED NECESSARY FOR ME TO STAY ON LONGER. IF I HAD ANY MORE PROBLEMS TO CALL MY SURGEON. WE DID THAT VERY NIGHT. I ENDED UP BACK IN THE ER WHEREAS THEY WANTED ME TO STAY OVERNIGHT FOR OBSERVATIONS. I DECLINED THIS FOR I HAD THREE SMALL CHILDREN AT HOME WAITING FOR MY HUSBAND AND I TO RETURN. THEY INSTRUCTED ME TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE SURGEON. I FOLLOWED UP WITHIN FOUR WEEKS TO MY SURGEON COMPLAINING OF CONSTANT DIARRHEA, ROCK HARD BOWELS, AND SHARP ABDOMINAL PAINS. I EVEN NOTED THAT THERE ARE SMALL LUMPS THAT YOU CAN FEEL THROUGH THE SKIN AROUND THE UMBILICAL AREA. HE INSTRUCTS ME THAT I NEED MORE TIME TO HEAL, AND THAT HE WAS NOT REOPENING ME BACK UP. THE NEXT THING I KNEW, I WAS SENT ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE OF DOCTORS AFTER DOCTORS, TESTS AFTER TESTS FOR 11 MONTHS NOW! I HAVE SEEN 8 DOCTORS, ALL SAYING THEY CANNOT HELP ME, IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS THIS: I HAVE HAD A MESH REPAIR BEFORE, AND I'VE BOUNCED BACK. THIS TIME I AM NOT. I AM SUFFERING SINCE THAT SURGERY DATE: SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAINS, I CANNOT WALK LONGER THAN 20 MINS WITHOUT SHOOTING PAINS, SO SHARP IT'S LIKE RAZORS RIPPING THROUGH MY STOMACH TO MY TOES. MY LEGS ARE NOW THROBBING WITH KNIFE LIKE PAINS TO THE TOES. SEVERE HEARTBURN DAILY. DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I EAT OR WHAT HEARTBURN MEDS I TAKE, NOTHING HELPS. I HAVE A DAILY LOW GRADE FEVER SINCE FEB, WITH EXTREME LOW BLOOD PRESSURE. MY WHITE BLOOD COUNT AND ANA LEVELS ARE ELEVATED AND NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN WHY. COUNTLESS CT SCANS AND MRI AND PET SCANS AND XRAYS ALL SAY NOTHING IS WRONG WITH ME. YET I HAVE LOST MY JOB DUE TO THE CONSTANT PAINS I FEEL DAILY. MY ABDOMEN IS SOFT TO THE TOUCH, AND I HAVE LUMPS ALL AROUND WHERE THE MESH IS IN PLACE. I CANNOT TOLERATE SEX NO MORE WITH MY HUSBAND, NOR ANYONE TOUCHING ME ON MY ABDOMEN. I SCREAM WHEN THEY DO. THE ABDOMEN IS NOT WARM TO THE TOUCH, HOWEVER PAINS SHOOT FROM THE UMBILICAL AREA TO MY TOES DAILY. MY NEWEST SYMPTOM IS KIDNEY PAINS DAILY. MY LEFT SIDE MORE THAN MY RIGHT SIDE. EVERY DOCTOR I HAVE SEEN SUSPECT IT IS THE MESH. THE MESH THAT WAS IMPLANTED IS: PROCEED 8X12; LOT NO: ZGG379; USE BY 2008. AGAIN I HAVE HAD A MESH REPAIR BEFORE, AND NEVER EVER HAD THESE PROBLEMS UNTIL THIS RECENT BOWEL SURGERY. I HAVE REPORTED THIS TO THAT SURGEON, AND 8 OTHER DOCTORS; ALL REFUSING TO REMOVE IT OR DO A SCOPE AND CHECK INTO IT FURTHER. I CANNOT LIVE THIS WAY.

SEVENTEEN DAYS LATER, THE PT MET WITH A SURGEON IN THE GENERAL SURGERY DEPARTMENT. THE SURGEON CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS AN INGUINAL HERNIA ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND A SMALL INGUINAL HERNIA ON THE LEFT SIDE. SURGERY TO REPAIR THE HERNIAS WAS THEN SCHEDULED FOR THE FOLLOWING MONTH. TWO WEEKS PRIOR, PT COMPLETED PRE-OP VISITS WITH A NURSE PRACTITIONER IN GENERAL SURGERY AND WITH THE ANESTHESIOLOGY STAFF.

THREE MONTHS LATER, THE PT MET WITH THE SURGEON FOR THE THREE MONTH FOLLOW-UP. AT THIS MEETING, THE PT AGAIN COMPLAINED OF THE CONSTANT PAIN AND SWELLING. AFTER BRINGING IN A FELLOW SURGEON TO COLLABORATE WITH, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RIGHT HERNIA WAS RECURRENT AND THAT THE MESH WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. THE SURGEONS DECIDED THAT THE HERNIA MESHES HAD TO BE REMOVED AND THE HERNIAS RE-REPAIRED. THE PT WAS CAUTIONED THAT THIS WOULD BE A COMPLEX PROCESS AS TISSUE NORMALLY ATTACHES TO THE HERNIA MESH AND THAT SPECIAL CARE WOULD HAVE TO BE EXERCISED TO NOT DAMAGE A BLOOD VESSEL OR CAUSE NERVE DAMAGE.

THE PATHOLOGY REPORT INDICATES A ""GROSS EVALUATION ONLY"" WAS CONDUCTED. THIS APPARENTLY WAS A CURSORY EVAL WITH NO OBSERVATIONS NOTED. THE PATHOLOGY DEPARTMENT INFORMED PT THAT SPECIMENS LIKE IN THIS CASE ARE NOT RETAINED OR RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER. IN LATE 2008, PT RETURNED TO THE GENERAL SURGERY DEPARTMENT TO HAVE 24 METAL STAPLES REMOVED FROM THE INCISIONS. PT SUFFERED SEVERE PAIN AFTER THE TEN DAYS EARLIER REPAIR SURGERY AND AS OF 2009, STILL EXPERIENCES DAILY PAIN EPISODES. PT FEELS THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL PAIN, EMOTIONAL, AND FINANCIAL DISTRESS CAUSED BY THE BARD 3DMAX MESH DEVICES THAT WERE IMPLANTED IN 2008. PT IS AWARE OF FDA WARNING LETTER ISSUED TO C.R. BARD INC. A WEEK EARLIER; WHICH INDICATES QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES AT THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING SITE.

I HAVE EXPERIENCED SAME SYMPTOMS AS THE OCTOBER 2008 FDA BULLETIN REGARDING THE TRANSVAGINAL PLACEMENT, EXCEPT THAT MINE WAS PLACED LAPAROSCOPICALLY THROUGH THE ABDOMEN. SURGERY WAS THE FOLLOWING MONTH, WITH 4 DAYS HOSPITALIZATION. THE FOLLOWING MONTH, I PRESENTED WITH HIGH FEVER 103, PAIN, DIFFICULTY URINATING, WEEPING OF FLUID FROM VAGINA; WHITE BLOOD COUNT EXCEEDING 17,000, 2 CT SCANS -ONE DONE THE NEXT DAY, AND THE OTHER ON THREE DAYS LATER, REVEALING A HEMATOMA/ABSCESS IN THE AREA OF ALL THE MESH GRAFTS. I WAS TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS, HOSPITALIZATION FOR 5 FULL DAYS. THEN IN EARLY 2009, I WAS HOSPITALIZED AGAIN FOR SEVERE ANTERIOR VAGINAL WALL EROSION WHERE THE MESH PLACED BETWEEN VAGINA AND BLADDER HAD ERODED COMPLETELY THROUGH THE VAGINAL WALL. THIS WAS PRECEDED BY VAGINAL DISCHARGE, AND PINK, BLOOD TINGED WEEPING. SURGICALLY MY VAGINA COULD NOT BE REPAIRED - IT WILL HAVE TO FORM SCAR TISSUE, AS THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH VAGINAL TISSUE REMAINING ON ANTERIOR WALL TO SEW THE ERODED EDGES TOGETHER WITHOUT CAUSING VAGINAL NARROWING - WHICH I DON'T KNOW - MAY STILL HAPPEN. THE UROGYNECOLOGIST SAID THEY POINT WHAT IS LEFT OF THE VAGINAL WALL IN THE CORRECT POSITION, SEW WHAT IS LEFT DOWN, AND THEN THE HOPE IS IT WILL GROW NEW TISSUE. SUBSEQUENTLY TWENTY FIVE DAYS LATER, HAD TO HAVE ERODING STITCHES CUT OUT OF POSTERIOR WALL; CAN FEEL MESH THROUGH THIN VAGINAL WALL AND NOW THIS WEEK, THE FOLLOWING MONTH, DISCOVERED MORE SCRATCHY MESH OR STITCHES. MY UNDERSTANDING FROM MY PHYSICIAN IS THAT THE MESH HE USED IS NOT ON THE LIST OF THE 9 TYPES OF MESH REPORTED IN 2008 BULLETIN. THIS WAS A MESH THAT TO HIS KNOWLEDGE, UNTIL WHAT HAPPENED TO ME, HAD NOT BEEN REPORTED AS CAUSING AN ADVERSE REACTION.

AFTER TESTS REVEALED A TOTAL BLOCKAGE IN MY SMALL INTESTINES, THEY RUSHED ME TO SURGERY. A LARGE SECTION OF MY SMALL INTESTINE WAS REMOVED BECAUSE THE MESH WAS ATTACHED TO IT IN TWO PLACES.

THE SURGERY WAS ABOUT 6 - 7 HOURS. I WAS TOLD THAT MESH WAS PLACED IN ABOUT 4 - 5 SECTIONS ABDOMINALLY AS WELL AS A LEAF OF MESH WAS PUT IN VAGINALLY.

A COUPLE OF MONTHS BEFORE THE SURGERY, MY GYNECOLOGIST ASKED ME ABOUT ANY URINARY LEAKAGE, WHICH I INDICATED ON OCCASION I EXPERIENCED SMALL AMOUNT WITH COUGHING OR SNEEZING. HE PERFORMED A URODIAGNOSTIC TEST AND CALLED ME ON THE PHONE TO TELL ME THAT HE COULD GO AHEAD AND PERFORM A ""BLADDER TAPING,"" WHICH WAS A ""SIMPLE AND ROUTINE"" PROCEDURE THAT WOULD BE DONE AT THE TIME OF MY HYSTERECTOMY AND INVOLVED ""PLACING A LITTLE MESH AROUND THE NECK OF THE BLADDER."" I HAD NEVER GONE TO MY DOCTOR WITH COMPLAINTS OF INCONTINENCE. MY UNDERSTANDING, SINCE I WAS HAVING OPEN ABDOMINAL SURGERY FOR THE HYSTERECTOMY, WAS THAT THE ""BLADDER TAPING"" WOULD BE DONE THROUGH THE ABDOMINAL INCISION. I WAS NOT TOLD OTHERWISE, NOR WOULD I HAVE EVEN KNOWN WHAT TO ASK, AND THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THE ""BLADDER TAPING"" INVOLVED OR THAT THERE WERE ANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROCEDURE. AFTER BEING DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL, I CALLED MY DOCTOR UPSET AND CONFUSED TO DISCOVER A CUT ON THE INSIDE OF MY LEFT GROIN - THERE WAS WHAT APPEARED TO BE A PLASTIC SHARD WORKING ITS WAY OUT OF THE CUT THAT WAS PAINFUL. MY DOCTOR SAID NOT TO WORRY IT WAS AN INCISION FROM THE BLADDER TAPING AND THE ""SHARD"" WAS JUST SURGICAL GLUE. I TOLD HIM I WAS UPSET THAT I HAD NOT BEEN TOLD THAT ANY ADDITIONAL INCISIONS WERE REQUIRED FOR THAT PROCEDURE. HE SAID NOT TO WORRY - IT WAS FINE. THEN I DISCOVERED A DUPLICATE INCISION ON THE OTHER SIDE AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER THAT SURGICAL GLUE CAUSED THE SAME PAINFUL PROBLEM UNTIL IT WORKED ITS WAY OUT OF THE INCISION. AT SIX WEEKS I RESUMED INTERCOURSE WITH MY HUSBAND, THE NIGHT BEFORE MY 6 WEEK POST-OP APPOINTMENT ONLY TO DISCOVER SOMETHING INSIDE MY VAGINA WAS SCRATCHING THE TOP OF MY HUSBAND'S PENIS AND THERE WAS A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE PULLING OR TIGHT SENSATION INSIDE MY VAGINA. FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MY SURGERY I INSERTED MY FINGERS IN MY VAGINA AND WAS HORRIFIED TO DISCOVER A LUMPY INCISION SITE WITH WHAT FELT LIKE A SCRATCHY PLASTIC EDGE COMING THROUGH IT. I WAS NEVER TOLD THERE WOULD BE AN INCISION IN MY VAGINA OR IN MY GROIN. I WAS SHAKING VERY UPSET WHEN I REPORTED THIS TO MY DOCTOR AND HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS - OR WHAT HAD BEEN DONE TO CAUSE THIS. BOTH HE AND HIS NURSE EXAMINED MY CLAIMING TO FEEL OR SEE NOTHING INSIDE. I TOLD MY DOCTOR HOW UPSET I WAS THAT WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS ""SIMPLE AND ROUTINE BLADDER TAPING"" INVOLVED A PROCEDURE I WAS NOT INFORMED ABOUT. HE TOOK ME INTO HIS OFFICE AND APOLOGIZED FOR NOT EXPLAINING IT PROPERLY TO ME, DISCOUNTED MY BALANCE BY 50% AND TOLD ME TO COME BACK IN 3 WEEKS AT NO CHARGE. THREE WEEKS LATER, I RETURNED WITH MORE SEVERE PROBLEMS INVOLVING MY HUSBAND'S PENIS BEING SCRATCHED AND NOT ONLY WAS THE TIGHT PULLING SENSATION WORSE, BUT I COULD FEEL WHAT FELT LIKE A STRAP DIGGING INTO MY VAGINA NEAR MY PUBIC BONE, THAT MADE SEX PAINFUL AND UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT COULD BE FELT WHEN I WAS SITTING OR LYING DOWN. I WAS SOBBING AND UPSET ABOUT WHAT WAS REALLY DONE WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE, THAT I FEEL BUTCHERED, AND INTIMACY WITH MY HUSBAND IS BEING RUINED. UPON EXAMINATION, THIS TIME MY DOCTOR SAID HE COULD FEEL AND SEE THE MESH, WHICH HE EXPLAINED HAD ""ERODED"" INTO MY VAGINA AND OFFERED TO ""SNIP"" IT OUT IN HIS OFFICE WHILE I WAS THERE. THROUGH MY TEARS, I TOLD HIM THAT THIS WOULD NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF MESH EMBEDDED IN MY VAGINAL WALL WITH SCAR TISSUE GROWING AROUND IT. HE THEN OFFERED, AT NO COST, TO DO A SMALL SURGICAL PROCEDURE INVOLVING AN INCISION BELOW MY URETHRA OPENING AND ""CUTTING THE TAPE TO RELEASE THE TENSION."" I TOLD HIM THAT I NEED TO GET A SECOND OPINION, THAT I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS DONE - WHICH IS WHY I'M IN THIS POSITON NOW - AND HAVE TO FIND OUT ALL MY OPTIONS SO THAT THIS PROBLEM CAN BE COMPLETED RESOLVED. HE OFFERED TO PAY FOR A SECOND OPINION AND TO PAY FOR WHATEVER SURGICAL PROCEDURE I WANT HIM TO DO TO TAKE CARE OF THIS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TYPE OF MESH WAS USED. MY DOCTOR SAID IT WAS ABOUT 1/4"" WIDE. I CAN'T EVENT DESCRIBE HOW DEVASTATING THIS IS - TO FIRST HAVE TRUSTED MY DOCTOR TO PROPERLY INFORM ME ABOUT ANY SURGICAL PROCEDURE I WAS CONSENTING TO , AND SECOND TO HAVE SUCH A FRIGHTENING AND HORRIFIC COMPLICATION HAPPENED. MY DOCTOR SAID HE'S PERFORMED THIS PROCEDURE ""HUNDREDS"" OF TIME AND I AM THE ONLY PATIENT OF HIS THIS HAS HAPPENED TO, BUT HE'S HEARD OF IT HAPPENING TO OTHER DOCTOR'S PATIENTS. THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE TEACHES THIS PROCEDURE. I AM HORRIFIED TO DISCOVER THAT THERE WAS AN FDA WARNING AGAINST THIS PROCEDURE IN 2008. I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE URODIAGNOSTIC TEST UNTIL AFTER THIS WARNING WAS ISSUED - AND MY DOCTOR NEVER SAID A WORD. WE LOST OUR HEALTH INSURANCE AFTER MY SURGERY IN EARLY 2009, AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE TO TURN FOR A TRUSTED SECOND OPINION OR WHO TO TRUST TO RESOLVE MY PROBLEM, IF IT CAN BE RESOLVED. THIS EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN SO DEVASTATING. I HAVE NOW LEARNED THAT I WILL HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER SURGERY TO REMOVE THE MESH AND TO TRY AND REPAIR THE VAGINAL SCAR. DATES OF USE: 2009 TO THE PRESENT.

I CANNOT SEEM TO GET HELP HERE AND THAT THE DOCTORS HERE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE SEVERE COMPLICATIONS, DUE TO THIS MESH AND WHAT I'M EXPERIENCING. PLEASE HELP GUIDE ME TO GET THIS FIXED. DUE TO ALL THE MEDICAL BILLS THAT KEEP ADDING UP, WE HAVE HAD TO FILE CHAPTER 7, WALK AWAY FROM MY HOME AND NOW CAN BARELY MAKE IT AS MORE MEDICAL BILLS KEEP PORING IN, YET NO HELP IS BEING DONE.

GENITAL NUMBNESS, ANORGASMIA, LOSS OF BLADDER AND URETHRAL SENSATION, SEXUAL IMPAIRMENT. FROM THE MORNING AFTER THE OPERATION, AND QUITE POSSIBLY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, THERE IS NO FEELING IN MY PENIS. ALTHOUGH ERECTION AND EJACULATION STILL FUNCTION, WITH INCREASING DIFFICULTY, THERE IS NO EROTIC SENSATION, NO PLEASURE, NO JOY, NO ORGASM, NO SEXUAL RELEASE AT ALL. I AM DEPRIVED OF THE ENJOYMENT OF THE MOST BASIC, INTIMATE, AND FUNDAMENTAL EXPRESSION OF WHAT IT IS TO BE MALE. WHILE I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS HAPPEN IN SURGERY, AND POSSIBLY THE FEMALE MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE HOW DEEPLY THIS FEELING DEFINES WHO WE ARE; NEVERTHELESS SOMETHING WENT VERY WRONG HERE. I RECEIVED PRACTICALLY ZERO INFORMATION FROM DR WHEN REQUESTED AND HAD TO DO THE MEDICAL RESEARCH MYSELF. WHEN DR FIRST APPEARED, SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY PISSED OFF AT HAVING BEEN CALLED OUT TO DO NORMALLY ELECTIVE SURGERY. SHE MADE A SARCASTIC REMARK, HEARD BY MYSELF, MY WIFE, AND STAFF, TO THE EFFECT THAT ""YOU LET THIS THING GO AND NOW YOU WANT ME TO FIX IT?"" WHEN I STATED I DID NOT WANT PLASTIC MESH BUT RATHER A SKILLFUL TENSION REPAIR, SHE BECAME EVEN MORE ANNOYED AND STATED SHE ""HADN'T DONE A TENSION REPAIR IN 9 YEARS AND DIDN'T THINK (SHE) COULD DO A GOOD JOB."" BEFORE PASSING OUT WITH PAIN, I TOLD HER TO ""USE YOUR BEST JUDGEMENT."" I CAN'T HELP THINKING THAT AN ANNOYED PERSON WOULD BE INCLINED TO BE HASTY, IMPATIENT, AND A LITTLE ROUGH. ON THE OPERATION REPORT, SHE PUT ""HE HAS REFUSED REPAIR IN THE PAST."" THIS IS MOST DEFINITELY NOT TRUE. I NEVER SOUGHT MEDICAL TREATMENT OR EVALUATION BEFORE FOR THE HERNIA. I HAVE SINCE LEARNED (ENCLOSURE) OF THE PROPER DOCTOR'S PROCEDURE TO SPONTANEOUSLY REDUCE A HERNIA, WHICH INVOLVES SEVERAL STEPS. I WAS HANDED AN ICE BAG AND TOLD TO REDUCE IT MYSELF. IT WAS INFLAMED AND WASN'T GOING BACK IN WITH THE SIMPLE PRESSURE I HAD ALWAYS USED IN THE PAST. I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT USING TWO HANDS, ONE CUPPING THE BRIM, FLEXING THE LEG FROGWISE, PUTTING A PILLOW BEHIND THE KNEES, AND HAVING A TILT TABLE HEADING DOWN 15 TO 20 DEGREES. IT WAS ""MUSHROOMING"" INSTEAD OF GOING BACK IN THE HOLE. I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT IF THIS HAD BEEN DONE ON ME WHILE CONSCIOUS, THE EDEMA THAT ALLEGEDLY OBSCURED THE NERVES WOULD HAVE SUBSIDED BEFORE THE SURGERY. ON WAKING AFTER SURGERY, I FOUND A VERY GREAT DEAL OF EDEMA IN THE PENIS SKIN, AND NUMBNESS. DR TOLD ME THAT WAS NORMAL SO I ASSUMED THE NUMBNESS WAS PROBABLY DUE TO THE EDEMA. THE ORGAN ITSELF STAYED PARTIALLY ERECT FOR TWO DAYS, WHICH I HAVE SINCE LEARNED IS A SIGN OF POSSIBLE NERVE DAMAGE. WHEN I HAD HEALED ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT GENTLE SEXUAL RELATIONS, I WAS HORRIFIED TO FIND THAT, ALTHOUGH THE BODY WAS WILLING AND ABLE TO PERFORM, THERE WAS NO FEELING, NO PLEASURE SENSATIONS AT ALL. NOTHING. I BROUGHT THIS UP TO DR AT 1ST FOLLOW-UP VISIT. SHE STATED THAT, ""OF COURSE WE STRIVE TO PRESERVE FUNCTION BUT THE ILIOINGUINAL NERVE RUNS RIGHT THROUGH THERE AND IS HARD TO AVOID. IT MAY RETURN, BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO RESIGN YOURSELF TO THE FACT THAT IT MAY NEVER COME BACK."" AT THE 2ND FOLLOW-UP, I BROUGHT THIS UP AGAIN AND SHE STATED THAT ""YOU LOOKED LIKE A HAND GRENADE WENT OFF IN THERE. THERE WAS SO MUCH EDEMA I COULDN'T IDENTIFY ANY ANATOMY, COULDN'T SEE ANY NERVES."" ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MALE SEXUALITY WAS MET WITH THE STONY SILENCE OF ONE IN FEAR OF LAWSUIT. IF DR LACKS RESPECT FOR THE ESSENTIAL ATTRIBUTE OF MALE GENDER, SHE SHOULD NOT BE OPERATING ON THAT AREA OF THE MALE ANATOMY. MY MOST SENSITIVE SECRET PLACES, THE GLANS, SULCUS, AND URETHRA ARE NOW UNFEELING AS IS THE PENILE SKIN. I DO HAVE BLADDER CONTROL, BUT EVEN THE BLADDER FULLNESS SENSATION IS NOW QUITE DIFFERENT. WHEN I CONSENTED TO TREATMENT, I WAS IN NO WAY INFORMED OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES TO MY SEXUAL FUNCTION. WHAT I WOULD LIKE DONE IS: CUT THROUGH THE RED TAPE THAT FORBIDS ME FROM SHOPPING FOR A UROLOGIST.

THIS DEVICE IS SO WRONG. AND HORRIBLE. IT HAS LITERALLY RUINED MY LIFE. MY BABIES, I CAN'T EVEN LIFT THEM OR GRAB THEM BY THEIR ARMS AND SWING THEM AROUND IN CIRCLES DUE TO THE PELVIC PAIN INSIDE MY BODY. SINCE I AM YOUR GUINEA PIG, YOUR ""CLINICAL TRIAL"", HERE'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT. IT IS ERODING OUT OF WHEREVER IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE, AND IS STUCK INSIDE MY VAGINA. I CAN FEEL IT WITH MY FINGER, AND MY HUSBAND CAN FEEL IT WITH HIS PENIS. IT HURTS HIM AND IT HURTS ME. IT MAKES THE INSIDE OF MY VAGINA STINK, NO MATTER WHAT I DO, DOUCHE, SOAP, WATER, BATHS, SWIMMING POOLS WITH CHLORINE, ANTIBIOTICS, NOTHING HELPS! THE SMELL IS THERE AND DISGUSTS ME EVERYTIME I ATTEMPT TO HAVE SEX WITH MY HUSBAND. THE INSIDES OF MY LEGS - CREVICES - MY GROIN HURTS ALL DAY LONG 24/7 AND HAS FOR 2 YEARS. I CAN'T EVEN WEAR PANTIES, OR BLUE JEANS BECAUSE IT CAUSES TOO MUCH PAIN. MY HIPS HURT AS WELL, EXCRUCIATING PAIN THAT EXTENDS INTO MY THIGHS AND BACK OF LEGS. I FEEL POKE, POKE, POKE, POKE, NO MATTER WHAT I AM DOING. SITTING HERE TYPING THIS, I FEEL POKE!!! IT'S SHARP AND HURTS. IT FEELS LIKE A PORCUPINE! I CAN HARDLY PEE WHEN I HAVE TO, AND THEN SOMETIMES I PEE WAY TOO MUCH. I CAN'T HOLD MY PEE AND HAVE PEED ON MYSELF IN PUBLIC ON MANY OCCASIONS. WHY DID THIS PRODUCT HAVE TO RUIN MY LIFE SO EARLY ON? IF I CAN HAVE SEX, IT IS INTERRUPTED SO MANY TIMES BY TRIPS TO THE TOILET, TO OF COURSE, PEE. OR PUSH SO HARD TO TRY AND PEE, AND NOTHING HAPPENS, BUT YET YOU FEEL AS IF YOUR BLADDER IS GOING TO BURST. I HAVE BEEN HELD BACK FROM MY BABIES, I CAN NO LONGER HAVE THEM NOW, AND THE ONE I DO HAVE, I HAVE HAD TO NOT HOLD THIS WAY, OR CAN'T ROCK HIM THIS WAY BECAUSE HIS FEET OR KNEES OR ELBOWS TOUCHING MY PELVIC CAUSE A HORRID PAIN. MY OLDEST CONSTANTLY SAYS ""MOMMA'S BLADDER IS HURTING HER, LITTLE BROTHER, LET HER SIT BY HERSELF."" WHAT CHILD SHOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT? OR BE WORRIED WITH THEIR MOMMY. I HAD MY CHILDREN YOUNG, AND WE HAD OUR WHOLE LIVES TO LIVE, HAPPY! INSTEAD, THEY HAVE SUFFERED FROM MY DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND MENTAL STATE DUE TO THIS MESH INSIDE MY VAGINA. IT'S NOT FAIR. YOU PEOPLE NEED TO GET THIS CREATION OFF THE MARKET. STOP DESTROYING WOMEN AND THEIR LIVES! THIS IS PITIFUL, PATHETIC. DESTROYING PEOPLES' LIVES ONE PIECE OF MESH IMPLANT AT A TIME!

PRESENTLY, THIS IS THE SUBJECT OF A MESSY LAW SUIT, BUT IN MY REVIEW OF THE RECORDS THAT HAVE RECENTLY COME INTO MY POSSESSION, I DO NOT SEE WHERE ANYONE HAS NOTIFIED THE FDA. THERE ARE 2 PARALLEL PROBLEMS OCCURRING AT THE SAME TIME. ONE IS A VENTROGLUTEAL INJECTION INTO THE SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES OF THE BUTTOCK WITH AN INJECTION OF TORADOL THAT SOME HAVE CONTENDED IS THE SOURCE OF THE INFECTION. NO GRAM POSITIVE (B)(6) OR OTHER SKIN PATHOGENS WERE FOUND. THE OTHER POSSIBLE DIAGNOSIS IS AN INFECTION DUE TO THE PLACEMENT OF MERSILENE MESH FROM A SACROCOLPOPEXY. THE SUIT IS NEARING SETTLEMENT. IF THIS IS A CONCERN OF YOURS PERHAPS YOU WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE INTERVENING AFTER THE FINAL DISPOSITION OF THE LEGAL CASE. THREE MONTHS AFTER THIS INJECTION, THE PT APPEARED AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL, (B)(6) WITH A FOUL SMELLING PURULENT VAGINAL DISCHARGE THAT STARTED 2 DAYS PRIOR. IT WAS NOTED BY THE GYNECOLOGICAL CONSULTANT THAT THERE APPEARED TO BE A SURGICAL SPONGE THAT HAD RUPTURED THROUGH THE VAGINAL WALL. THE PT WAS SEPTIC. SHE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SENT TO (B)(6) HOSPITAL, (B)(6) AND AFTER A 16 HOUR PERIOD UNDERWENT SURGERY FOR EVACUATION OF THE PERI-PELVIC ABSCESS, ADJACENT GLUTEAL ABSCESS AND REMOVAL OF THE MERSILENE MESH. THE PHYSICIANS WHO CARED FOR HER DETERMINED THAT THE PT DID NOT HAVE A FAILURE OR COMPLICATION OF A MEDICAL DEVICE, BUT INSTEAD HAD THE ABOVE PROBLEM DUE TO THE SUPERFICIAL IM INJECTION GIVEN 3 MONTHS EARLIER. AFTER MY RESEARCH, I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS IS A DEVICE FAILURE. THE GLUTEAL ABSCESSES GREW OUT FUSOBACTERIUM NUCLEATUM AND ACTINOMYCES. TODAY I WAS COMPARING THE 2 MRI'S OF THE AREA TAKEN 16 HOURS APART AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL AND I NOTICED THAT THE PELVIC ABSCESS FIRST SEEN WAS A MULTILOCULATED 9 CM X 9 CM ABSCESS GREW TO A 12.8 CM X 16.2 CM SIZE IN THIS SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. I CAN ONLY ATTRIBUTE THIS TO A GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA. I WOULD NOT EXPECT GRAM NEGATIVES TO GROW ON THE SKIN OR BE A CONTAMINATE IN THE TORADOL. THE RECORDS HAVE ONLY RECENTLY COME INTO MY POSSESSION. AT THIS TIME I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE INITIAL SURGICAL REPORT IN (B)(6). I RECENTLY NOTED THAT THE (B)(6) HAS PUT OUT AN ADVISORY IN JAN 2009 FOR THIS PROCEDURE AS INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURE GUIDANCE 284. THE DATA I CAN GIVE YOU IS AS FOLLOWS. (B)(6).

THE SECOND DOCTOR WITHOUT TELLING ME HAD IMPLANTED ANOTHER MESH. I WAS TOLD BY THIS SECOND DOCTOR 2 DAYS AFTER SURGERY THAT I HAVE A GORE-TEX MESH WHICH WILL NOT GIVE ME ANY PROBLEMS. I TOOK THAT ADVICE AND WENT BACK TO MY REGULAR LIFE. AFTER LIKE 2 MONTHS AFTER THE SECOND SURGERY I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE TO BE TIRED AND WEAK AGAIN. LATER MILD FEVER CAME BACK, BRUISES, AND THE MESH STARTED TO CAUSE PAIN WHEN I WAS STANDING UP OR COUGHING. I WAS SURE THE MESH WAS THE PROBLEM. I FOUND A THIRD DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN EXPERIENCED HERNIA SPECIALIST WHO REPAIRS HERNIAS OLD-FASHION WAY WITHOUT THE MESH. JUST IN CASE I HAD A PLACE TO GO IF MY SYMPTOMS WOULD GET WORSE. LIKE AFTER 8 MONTHS AFTER THE SECOND SURGERY SOME PARTS OF MY BODY STARTED TO BURN -STOMACH, LUNGS, MESH AREA-. I STARTED EXPERIENCING A CAUGHT WHICH WILL WOULD NOT GO AWAY. I CONTACTED THE THIRD DOCTOR AND HAD A THIRD SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2010. IN THIS LAST SURGERY, THE MESH HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EX-PLANTED AND MY REPAIR WAS COMPLETED OLD-FASHION TECHNIQUE USING SUTURES. THE THIRD DOCTOR HAD TOLD ME THE MESH AREA HAD INFLAMMATION PRESENT. HE ALSO MAINTAINED THAT THE SECOND DOCTOR SHOULD NOT HAVE PLACED A SECOND MESH WHEN BODY IS REJECTING THE FIRST MESH. TODAY I KNOW THAT IT HAS ONLY BEEN TWO MONTHS, BUT I FEEL GREAT! I HAVE NO MORE PROBLEMS AND I FEEL NOTHING UNDER MY SKIN IN THE HERNIA AREA. I FEEL LIKE I GOT MY LIFE BACK!

ACCORDING TO THE REPORT INFLAMMATION WAS PRESENT, AND MESH HAD GREW IT SELF AROUND THE VAS-DEFERN -SPERM CORD-. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SURGERY I FELT GOOD! THE PAIN WAS GONE! OTHER SYMPTOMS WERE ALMOST GONE! I THOUGHT THE MESH IS COMPLETELY REMOVED AND I DON'T HAVE ANY FOREIGN BODY INSIDE ME! THEN I FOUND OUT I WAS WRONG! THE SECOND DOCTOR WITHOUT TELLING ME HAD IMPLANTED ANOTHER MESH. I WAS TOLD BY THIS SECOND DOCTOR 2 DAYS AFTER SURGERY THAT I HAVE A GORE-TEX MESH WHICH WILL NOT GIVE ME ANY PROBLEMS. I TOOK THAT ADVICE AND WENT BACK TO MY REGULAR LIFE. AFTER LIKE 2 MONTHS AFTER THE SECOND SURGERY I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE TO BE TIRED AND WEAK AGAIN. LATER MILD FEVER CAME BACK, BRUISES, AND THE MESH STARTED TO CAUSE PAIN WHEN I WAS STANDING UP OR COUGHING. I WAS SURE THE MESH WAS THE PROBLEM. I FOUND A THIRD DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN EXPERIENCED HERNIA SPECIALIST WHO REPAIRS HERNIAS OLD-FASHION WAY WITHOUT THE MESH. JUST IN CASE I HAD A PLACE TO GO IF MY SYMPTOMS WOULD GET WORSE. LIKE AFTER 8 MONTHS AFTER THE SECOND SURGERY SOME PARTS OF MY BODY STARTED TO BURN -STOMACH, LUNGS, MESH AREA-. I STARTED EXPERIENCING A CAUGHT WHICH WILL WOULD NOT GO AWAY. I CONTACTED THE THIRD DOCTOR AND HAD A THIRD SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2010. IN THIS LAST SURGERY, THE MESH HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EX-PLANTED AND MY REPAIR WAS COMPLETED OLD-FASHION TECHNIQUE USING SUTURES. THE THIRD DOCTOR HAD TOLD ME THE MESH AREA HAD INFLAMMATION PRESENT. HE ALSO MAINTAINED THAT THE SECOND DOCTOR SHOULD NOT HAVE PLACED A SECOND MESH WHEN BODY IS REJECTING THE FIRST MESH. TODAY I KNOW THAT IT HAS ONLY BEEN TWO MONTHS, BUT I FEEL GREAT! I HAVE NO MORE PROBLEMS AND I FEEL NOTHING UNDER MY SKIN IN THE HERNIA AREA. I FEEL LIKE I GOT MY LIFE BACK! PLEASE CONSIDER RECALLING SOME OF THESE MESHES. ALSO PLEASE REQUIRE GENERAL SURGEONS TO BE TRAINED IN MESH EXPLANATION AND OLD-FASHION REPAIRS. I KNOW THAT SOME DOCTORS LACK EXPERIENCE OF THESE TWO PROCEDURES WHICH COULD BE LIFE THREATENING. THANK YOU. DATES OF USE: (B)(6) 2008 - (B)(6) 2010.

HE TOLD ME HE HAD DONE HUNDREDS OF THESE AND THEY WERE NO BIG DEAL. BECAUSE OF MY YOUNGER AGE, HE SAID THAT I WOULD BE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR THE MESH IMPLANT AS BEING MORE ACTIVE AND BEING A NURSE, THIS WOULD LAST A LOT LONGER AS JUST BEING ""TACKED UP"" WOULD PROBABLY MAKE IT NECESSARY THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE IT REPEATED IN 10 YEARS OR SO, BUT WITH THE MESH, IT WOULD LAST AT LEAST 20 YEARS AND MAYBE NEVER HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER SURGERY. HE NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING ABOUT MESH EROSION BEING A RISK, NOR ANY OTHER COMPLICATIONS. ONLY THING THAT WAS REVIEWED WAS THE BASIC ""SURGERY RISKS"" ANESTHESIA, BLEEDING, ETC. ONE WEEK AFTER MY SURGERY WHEN THE MAJOR PAIN WAS SUBSIDING, I NOTICED THAT I WAS HAVING A LOT OF PAIN IN MY GROIN AND I COULDN'T WALK NORMALLY AS I WOULD HAVE TO SHORTEN MY STRIDE WITH EACH STEP. A FULL STRIDE CAUSED A SHARP PAIN IN MY RIGHT GROIN. I CALLED THE DR AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD ADDRESS IT AT MY POST-OP AS I WASN'T HAVING ANY FEVER OR OTHER PROBLEMS AND MAYBE THIS WAS JUST LIGAMENT PAIN, ETC. AT MY 4 WEEK POST-OP, I CAME TO THE OFFICE AND REVIEWED WITH THE NURSE THAT I WAS STILL HAVING THE PAIN IN MY GROIN AND I HAD ALSO STARTED HAVING VAGINAL BLEEDING. MY DR DID A VERY PAINFUL PELVIC. I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE GROIN PAIN AND I ALSO TOLD HIM THAT I WAS REALLY CONCERNED AS THE BLEEDING WAS CAUSING CRAMPING AS WELL. I HAD A TOTAL HYSTERECTOMY IN 1997, SO BLEEDING WAS NOT EXPECTED. I ALSO TOLD THE DR THAT I PHYSICALLY ""CHECKED MYSELF -CAREFULLY"" AND FELT SOME VERY SHARP AREAS IN MY VAGINA AND THAT I FELT SOMETHING WAS REALLY WRONG. HE SAID ""COULD BE SCAR TISSUE"" AND HE TOLD ME TO REST ONE MORE WEEK, CONTINUE WITH THE ESTROGEN CREAM AND COME BACK. UPON RETURN, I TOLD HIM THAT THINGS WERE CONTINUING BUT WEREN'T ANY WORSE AND I WAS WORRIED ABOUT MY JOB. HE SAID THINGS WOULD GET BETTER, THAT IT WAS OKAY TO GO BACK TO WORK AND I RETURNED TO WORK (B)(6) 2010. ON (B)(6) 2010, I CALLED THE OFFICE AND TALKED TO THE NURSE STATING THAT MY LEG WAS STILL REALLY BOTHERING ME AND I ASKED IF I COULD HAVE THE NAME OF THE MESH THAT WAS INSERTED. I HAD READ ABOUT EROSIONS ONLINE AS I WAS SCARED AND WHEN I PUT MY SYMPTOMS IN ""POST-OP TVT BLEEDING"" HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS CAME UP ABOUT EROSIONS. I WAS HORRIFIED THEN AS I STILL AM. I HAVE BEEN BACK TO THE DR AND HE WAS UNABLE TO DO A PELVIC ON ME AS THE PAIN WAS TOO SEVERE. I ASKED HIM IF THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ONE OF HIS PTS AND HE SAID, ""YES, I HAD A (B)(6) PT THIS HAPPENED TO."" HE DIDN'T TELL ME WHAT WAS WRONG, ONLY THAT HE WANTED ME TO SEE THIS SPECIALIST (WHO I HAD TRIED TO GET TO DO THE SURGERY AND I WAS TOLD THERE WAS AT LEAST 6 MONTHS WAIT), AND HE GOT ME IN ONE HOUR AFTER MY APPOINTMENT WITH HIM. I WENT TO HER OFFICE, WAS TOLD THAT I HAD REALLY BAD EROSION, IN AT LEAST 5 AREAS, AND THAT MY URETHRA HAD ERODED AS WELL. MY FIRST DR CALLED ME AT HOME THAT FOLLOWING SUNDAY NIGHT AND ASKED WHAT THE SPECIALIST SAID AND WHEN I TOLD HIM SHE SAID IT WOULD ALL HAVE TO COME OUT HE SAID, ""WELL I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN WITH A PT BEFORE"" (OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE TOLD ME PREVIOUSLY) AND HE SAID THAT HE WONDERED IF THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MATERIAL THAT WAS USED IN MAKING THE MESH PRODUCT.""

ACCORDING TO OP RECORDS, MY OB/GYN UTILIZED 2 MINS OF 103 JOULES TO THE MESH THEN REMOVED IT. I CONTINUED TO ""SPOT"" MONTHLY AFTER THE PROCEDURE AND GRADUALLY (OVER A FEW MONTHS) THE PAIN I HAD BEEN EXPERIENCING PRIOR, HAD RETURNED AND GOTTEN SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE. EVERY MONTH I WOULD SPOT AND THE PAIN WOULD INCREASE IN INTENSITY AND SEVERITY. SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE PROCEDURE, MY PAIN WAS EXCRUCIATING, CAUSING ME TO BE IMMOBILE, NAUSEOUS, AND AT TIMES, FEELING AS IF I WOULD PASS OUT IF I TRIED TO MOVE OR STAND. I INFORMED MY OB/GYN OF THESE ADVERSE REACTIONS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO TAKE IBUPROFEN AND USE A HEATING PAD.

THE FOLLOWING MONTH, (B)(6) 2005, WHEN THE PAIN BECAME UNBEARABLE, INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO MY OB/GYN, I CALLED MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WHO SAW ME RIGHT AWAY AND SENT ME TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR EVAL. THE EMERGENCY ROOM ADMITTED ME, DID AN ABDOMINAL MRI, AND HELD ME OVERNIGHT. THE SURGEON RELEASED ME THE NEXT DAY STATING I WAS NOT A ""SURGICAL"" CANDIDATE. THE MRI SCANNED ONLY MY ABDOMEN, NOT MY PELVIC AREA - BUT THE SURGEON WAS CONFIDENT THAT IT WAS ""GASTROENTERITIS."" AS A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL MYSELF - I WAS CONFIDENT HE WAS WRONG. THE FOLLOWING MONTH, (B)(6) 2005, WHEN THE PAIN RETURNED, I REPORTED TO A DIFFERENT (BETTER) EMERGENCY ROOM WHERE A COMPLETE MRI AND PELVIC ULTRASOUND WERE PERFORMED.

PT WAS OUT OF WORK FOR FOUR MONTHS DUE TO ABDOMINAL PAIN, BLADDER INFECTIONS, AND URINARY INCONTINENCE. PT STATES SHE WOULD BE UP 2-3 TIMES A NIGHT DUE TO CONSTANT PAIN. PT HAD CT SCAN WHICH WAS NEGATIVE. HER DOCTOR ELECTED TO DO A REVISION ON (B)(6) 2011 TO ADJUST THE SLING. PER PT, THE DOCTOR TOLD HER SLING WAS COMPRESSING HER URETHRA AND IT HAD MIGRATED FORWARD.

THE TRANS-VAGINAL TAPE WAS PLACED BECAUSE OF STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE. DURING CONSULTATION THE DOCTOR TOLD ME HE WOULD PLACE A SLING WHICH WAS BASICALLY LIKE A HAMMOCK. HE WOULD DO THIS PROCEDURE VAGINALLY AND HE WOULD ATTACH THE SLING AT THE SITE OF MY OLD HYSTERECTOMY INCISION. I HAD TOTAL TRUST IN HIM AND THE INFORMATION GIVEN TO ME ABOUT MY SURGERY WAS THAT IT WOULD SOLVE MY PROBLEM. THE SURGERY WENT WELL AND IT HELPED WITH MY URINARY STRESS INCONTINENCE. IN 2005, I SUFFERED FROM SEVERAL BLADDER INFECTIONS AND THE DOCTOR AT THE URGENT CARE FACILITY TOLD ME TO START USING A VAGINAL ESTROGEN CREAM BECAUSE SHE FELT THE INFECTIONS WERE DUE TO SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WHEN I TOLD HER I WOULD BLEED BECAUSE OF PAINFUL SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH MY HUSBAND. IN 2006 - THREE YEARS AFTER THE MESH WAS IMPLANTED, I BEGAN SUFFERING FROM EXTREME PAIN DURING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE AND I WENT TO SEE THE GYNECOLOGIST WHICH TOLD ME THE TISSUE IN THE VAGINAL CANAL WAS BECOMING THIN AND HE AGAIN PRESCRIBED AN ESTROGEN VAGINAL CREAM, HE SAID THE VAGINAL TISSUE WOULD BECOME STRONGER WITH THE USE OF THE CREAM. I CONTINUED HAVING SEVERE PAIN DURING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE AND MANY TIMES I WOULD BLEED AFTER INTERCOURSE AND FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS I WOULD HAVE PAIN IN MY VAGINAL CANAL AND LOWER ABDOMEN. ONE DAY AFTER EXPERIENCING SEVERE PAIN IN MY VAGINAL CANAL I EXAMINED MYSELF AND FELT A PLASTIC TAPE IN MY VAGINAL TISSUES AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO TOUCH THE AREA. I WAS SCARED I COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHERE THE PLASTIC TAPE COULD BE COMING FROM, THEN I REALIZED THAT THE MESH HAD PROTRUDED THROUGH MY VAGINAL CANAL AND THAT AN EROSION OCCURRED. I IMMEDIATELY MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY GYNECOLOGIST AND DURING THE EXAMINATION HE TOLD ME HE COULD SEE THE BLUE TAPE PROTRUDING INTO MY VAGINAL TISSUES. HE REFERRED ME TO A UROLOGIST AND WITHIN A FEW DAYS I HAD SURGERY TO REMOVE THE MESH. THE SURGERY WAS DONE ON (B)(6) 2009. THE UROLOGIST TOLD ME HE TRIED TO REMOVE AS MUCH OF THE MESH AS HE COULD BUT EVEN PULLING AS HARD AS HE COULD, IT WOULD NOT BECOME LOOSE BECAUSE THERE WAS TISSUE GROWING ALL AROUND IT. THIS EXCISION OF THE MESH RELIEVED THE PAIN FOR ABOUT A YEAR. ON (B)(6) 2010 THE PAIN RETURNED AND I AGAIN STARTED EXPERIENCING PAIN DURING INTERCOURSE AND BLEEDING AFTERWARD. I EXAMINED MYSELF AND I AGAIN COULD FEEL THE TAPE IN MY VAGINAL CANAL. I WENT TO SEE THE GYNECOLOGIST AND HE TOLD ME TO START USING THE ESTROGEN VAGINAL CREAM AGAIN AND THAT THIS WOULD HELP WITH THE PAIN. AT THE SAME TIME, I HAD A SMALL LUMP ON MY LEFT BREAST AND THE DOCTOR FELT WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON MAKING SURE MY BREAST WAS OKAY SO HE ORDERED A MAMMOGRAM AND AN ULTRASOUND. NO CANCER WAS DETECTED. THE GYNECOLOGIST FELT THE MESH COULD WAIT A FEW MORE MONTHS. I CONTINUED THE USE OF THE ESTROGEN VAGINAL CREAM. THE VAGINAL PAIN CONTINUED BUT IT WAS MANAGEABLE AND THE ESTROGEN VAGINAL CREAM SEEMED TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BETTER. I TRULY WAS AFRAID OF AGAIN HAVING SURGERY TO REMOVE THE MESH. THE PAST FOUR MONTHS, I NOTICED THE PAIN WAS BECOMING MORE INTENSE AND CONSTANT AND I STARTED EXPERIENCING PAIN IN MY LOWER BACK THAT RADIATES TO MY LEFT LEG. THIS (B)(6) 2011, THE VAGINAL PAIN STARTED GETTING EXCRUCIATING AND I ALSO NOTICED PRESSURE AND PAIN IN MY LOWER ABDOMEN UPON WAKING UP IN THE MORNING, AND SEVERE PAIN WHERE MY OLD HYSTERECTOMY INCISION IS LOCATED, TO THE POINT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO STAND UP FOR MORE THAN 20 MINUTES AND SITTING DOWN WAS ALSO BECOMING UNCOMFORTABLE. I WENT TO SEE MY GYNECOLOGIST AND AFTER A VERY PAINFUL EXAMINATION HE COULD AGAIN FEEL THE TVT MESH IN MY VAGINAL CANAL AND HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE PAIN I WAS EXPERIENCING ON MY OVARIES SO HE SENT ME TO HAVE AN ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC ULTRASOUND. THE ULTRASOUND TURNED OUT OKAY, NO PROBLEMS WITH MY OVARIES. HE REFERRED ME TO THE UROLOGIST, WHICH I SAW LAST (B)(6) 2011 AND AFTER EXAMINATION WITH THE UROLOGIST HE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO HAVE SURGERY TO REMOVE THE MESH. HE TOLD ME IT WOULD BE A COMPLICATED SURGERY AND HE WOULD NEED ANOTHER UROLOGIST TO ASSIST HIM BECAUSE I NEEDED BOTH VAGINAL SURGERY TO REMOVE THE MESH FROM THE CANAL AND ABDOMINAL SURGERY TO REMOVE THE MESH FROM WHERE IT HAD BEEN ATTACHED AT THE OLD HYSTERECTOMY INCISION. I LIVE IN CHRONIC PAIN, AM UNABLE TO SIT, STAND, OR WALK FOR LONG PERIODS AND I AM UNABLE TO HAVE SEX WITHOUT PAIN. IT HAS AFFECTED MY MARRIAGE AND MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY SPOUSE HAS SUFFERED BECAUSE OF THIS. IT IS INTERFERING WITH MY DAILY ACTIVITIES.

AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, I DEVELOPED A VAGINAL DISCHARGE/INFECTION, WHICH BECAME PROLONGED. I CONTACTED, AND RETURNED TO THE OPERATING UROGYNECOLOGIST WHO TESTED AND CONFIRMED IT WAS A YEAST INFECTION. I HAVE NOT HAD A (B)(6) IN MANY YEARS. THE UROGYNECOLOGIST STATED THAT THE INFECTION WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE MESH. HE PRESCRIBED ME CREAM; AFTER TWO THERAPIES IT DID NOT WORK. HE PRESCRIBED ME ONE FLUCONAZOLE, AND DIRECTED ME TO SEE A GENERAL GYNECOLOGIST. THE ONE FLUCONAZOLE TABLET DID NOT WORK, SO I ASKED MY FAMILY DOCTOR FOR A LONGER DOSE. HE COMPLIED, AND I WENT ON FLUCONAZOLE FOR ONE MONTH. FLUCONAZOLE IS SOMETIMES RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WITH FIBROMYALGIA, THE PRESUPPOSITION BEING THERE MAY BE A CONCOMITANT (B)(6) . HOWEVER, THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF MY DIAGNOSIS OF FIBROMYALGIA, I NEVER EXPERIENCED ONE VAGINAL YEAST INFECTION. AFTER ONE MONTH ON FLUCONAZOLE, THE INFECTION RETURNED. I SAW THE TELEVISION LAWYER ADVERTISEMENTS REGARDING PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MESH SLING, WHICH CONCERNED ME. I CALLED THE UROGYNECOLOGIST WHO PERFORMED THE PROCEDURE AGAIN, AND EXPLAINED THE PERSISTENT (B)(6). HE IS AN EXCELLENT DOCTOR, HOWEVER, HE WAS ADAMANT THAT THE BLADDER SLING DOES NOT CAUSE (B)(6). I ADVISED HIM THAT I DID SOME ONLINE RESEARCH, AND LEARNED THAT INFECTION HAS BEEN LINKED TO THE MESH. HE ADVISED ME THAT THE ""INFORMATION I WAS READING WAS INACCURATE, AND THAT ANYONE CAN POST UNTRUE INFORMATION."" I TOLD HIM THAT WHAT I READ ABOUT PERSISTENT (B)(6) FOLLOWING THE IMPLANTING OF THE MESH, MIRRORED MY OWN EXPERIENCE. HE STRONGLY INSISTED THAT THE MESH DOES NOT CAUSE (B)(6). HE ASKED ME IF IT COULD BE SOMETHING ELSE HOWEVER, AS MY HUSBAND POINTED OUT, HE WAS THE ONE WHO DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS (B)(6). I ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE COULD POSSIBLY BE SOMETHING ELSE CAUSING THE PROBLEM, BUT THE TIMING OF THE ONSET OF SYMPTOMS, AND THE FACT THAT I NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE, THAT I DIDN'T THINK SO. I ADVISED HIM THAT THE (B)(6) WAS PROLIFIC, AND ASKED HIM FOR A DOSE OF FLUCONAZOLE. HE REFUSED, STATING IT IS A VERY STRONG DRUG. I APPRECIATE HIS CONCERNS - HOWEVER I AM VERY CONCERNED AND TROUBLED BECAUSE I AM NOT BEING TREATED FOR THIS PROBLEM. THIS COULD SERIOUSLY AFFECT MY HEALTH AND I WANT TREATMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I TOLD THE DOCTOR IT WAS AFFECTING MY IMMUNE SYSTEM, AND WAS PULLING ME DOWN. IT IS CERTAINLY AFFECTING THE QUALITY OF MY LIFE. NO PERSON SHOULD GO UNTREATED FOR A VALID MEDICAL PROBLEM, DUE TO LACK OF QUALITY OF INFORMATION REGARDING A MEDICAL DEVICE. I FEEL MY EXPERIENCE IS BEING INVALIDATED. I NOW HAVE TO GO TO, AND PAY ANOTHER DOCTOR, MEANWHILE BEING LEFT UNTREATED IN THE INTERIM. THE UROGYNECOLOGIST, DR.

(B)(6), FOR AN INCONTINENCE PROBLEM. I WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH URINE LEAKAGE WHEN I LAUGHED, JUMPED, OR COUGHED. DR. (B)(6) SAID THE PROBLEM COULD BE FIXED WITH BLADDER SLING SURGERY. I WAS NOT OFFERED ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE. THE SURGERY WAS SCHEDULED AND ASIDE FROM BEING IN THE LITHOTOMY POSITION, THE SURGERY ITSELF WAS PRETTY MUCH PAINLESS. THIS WAS OUTPATIENT SURGERY AND I WAS ABLE TO GO HOME THE SAME DAY W/O A CATHETER. AFTER THE SURGERY AND AT MY F/U APPOINTMENT A FEW WEEKS LATER, I REPORTED TO DR. (B)(6) THAT I WAS HAVING TROUBLE URINATING WITH ANY FORCE AND HE SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS THIS WAS BECAUSE THE SLING WAS A ""LITTLE TIGHT"" AND THAT THIS SHOULD RESOLVE OVER TIME. THIS DID RESOLVE SOME BUT I FIGURED THAT THIS WAS JUST THE PRICE I WOULD PAY TO AVOID THE INCONTINENCE ISSUES I HAD BEFORE SURGERY. IN 2008, I BEGAN TO HAVE LOW BACK PAIN THAT RADIATED INTO MY RIGHT HIP. I WAS SEEN BY MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN, DR. (B)(6), AND HE DIRECTED ME TO AN ORTHOPAEDISTS, DR. (B)(6). DR. (B)(6) PRESCRIBED SOME PREDNISONE AND TOLD ME TO TAKE IT EASY FOR THE NEXT WEEK OR UNTIL I FELT BETTER. THE PROBLEM CAME BACK AND I WAS PRESCRIBED YET ANOTHER DOSAGE OF METHYL-PREDNISOLONE WHICH AGAIN CORRECTED THE PROBLEM SHORT TERM. WHEN IT RETURNED, I WENT BACK TO DR. (B)(6) WHO THEN SUGGESTED THAT I TRY PHYSICAL THERAPY. I TRIED THAT BUT HAD NO RESULTS SO I TERMINATED ANY FUTURE APPOINTMENTS WITH THE PT DEPARTMENT. I CONTINUED TO LIVE WITH THE PAIN UNTIL A FRIEND SUGGESTED THAT I TRY A CHIROPRACTOR. I SAW DR. (B)(6) FOR A NUMBER OF WEEKS AND HE FINALLY TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAD SOME CHANGES BY THAT TIME THAT HE WASN'T SEEING. HE SUGGESTED I SEE DR. (B)(6) WHO IS A LOCAL PHYSIATRIST. I BEGAN SEEING DR. (B)(6) IN EARLY 2011 AND WAS RECEIVING TRIGGER POINT INJECTIONS EVERY 3 MONTHS BUT THE EFFECTS WERE ONLY SHORT TERM. IN (B)(6) 2011, DR. (B)(6) SUGGESTED THAT WE TRY A SERIES OF INJECTIONS OVER A FOUR WEEK PERIOD TO SEE IF WE COULD GET ANY DIFFERENT RESULTS. BEGINNING JUST BEFORE (B)(6) 2011 AND THE FOLLOWING 4 WEEKS, I REC'D APPROX 26 INJECTIONS ANYWHERE FROM MY ANKLE TO MY KNEE TO MY HIP AND INTO MY LOWER BACK. NONE OF THESE INJECTIONS HAS HELPED. DR. (B)(6) THEN SUGGESTED THAT I GIVE PHYSICAL THERAPY A TRY AND REFERRED ME TO MOTION WORKS WHERE I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PHYSICAL THERAPIST, (B)(6). (B)(6) ALSO FEELS THAT I SHOULD HAVE SOME POSITIVE RESULTS BY NOW BUT I AM STILL IN THE SAME POSITION I WAS IN PRIOR TO WORKING WITH HIM. IN LATE (B)(6) 2011, I ASKED DR. (B)(6) IF WE COULD DO AN MRI TO SEE WHAT IF ANYTHING WAS GOING ON IN MY BACK. HE SCHEDULED THE MFR FOR (B)(6) AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL. YESTERDAY, (B)(6) 2012, I WAS TOLD BY DR. (B)(6) THAT WHILE THERE WERE SOME SMALL THINGS THAT CAME UP ON MY MRI, THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE CAUSING THE TYPE OF PAIN I WAS HAVING. HE HAS SPOKEN WITH MY PHYSICAL THERAPIST AND THEY HAVE SUGGESTED THAT I GO BACK TO DR. (B)(6), MY UROLOGIST, TO DETERMINE IF THE BLADDER SLING IS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. BOTH THE PHYSIATRIST AND MY PHYSICAL THERAPIST BELIEVE THAT THERE COULD BE A LINK. THEY HAVE CONCERNS THAT THE MESH ITSELF OR THE WAY IT WAS ATTACHED MAY BE THE REASON FOR THIS EXCRUCIATING PAIN IN MY LOW BACK AND RIGHT HIP. NOT ONLY DO I CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE RELEASE OF MY URINE BUT I AM ALSO CURRENTLY HAVING TO TAKE TRAMADOL SEVERAL TIMES A DAY TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF MY PAIN. I CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH RELEASING MY URINE. MY BLADDER CAN FEEL VERY FULL BUT I AM UNABLE TO RELEASE MY URINE VERY QUICKLY. I HAVE RESEARCHED THE PROBLEMS OTHERS ARE HAVING WITH THE MESH BLADDER SLINGS AND AM FINDING THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME DIFFICULTIES THAT I AM. MY NEXT STEP IS TO DISCUSS AN EPIDURAL BLOCK WITH A PAIN MANAGEMENT SPECIALIST BUT I AM UNSURE AT THIS POINT IF THE EPIDURAL INJECTION WILL WORK.

RELUCTANTLY AND AFTER CONSULTING SEVERAL DOCTORS I DECIDED I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROCEDURE THAT WAS COVERED BY MY INSURANCE COMPANY, RATHER THAN SUFFER IN SILENCE. UNFORTUNATELY I HAD SEVERAL COMPLICATIONS AS A RESULT OF EITHER ONE OR BOTH PROCEDURES. FIRST, AFTER 6 MONTHS OF COMPLAINING, I DISCOVERED THAT A FOREIGN BODY (A NON-INJECTABLE CATHETER CAP) HAD BEEN LEFT IN MY BODY FOR 6 MONTHS AND WORSE YET WAS GETTING REALLY SICK. I HAVE SINCE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH SLE LUPUS CONFIRMED BY A POSITIVE ANA AND ANTI-DNA TESTS. I KNOW THAT MY BODY MUST BE REJECTING THE TAPE, BUT THE DRS WILL NOT HEAR OF IT. IN FACT THE TAPE THAT I WAS TOLD COULD EASILY BE REMOVED IN DEED COULD NOT AS THE COMPLICATIONS INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS WERE EQUALLY AS RISKY. I AM TIRED OF BEING TOLD I AM NUTS, BUT WANTED TO REPORT MY EXPERIENCE ALL THE SAME, IN HOPES IT MAY PREVENT SOMEONE ELSE FROM DEVELOPING THIS DEBILITATING DISEASE KNOWN AS LUPUS.

SHE HAD REVISION SURGERY IN (B)(6) 1999 DUE TO PAIN AND BLEEDING. SHE WAS IMPLANTED WITH A MESH TVT THROUGH A VAGINAL INCISION AT THIS TIME. AS A RESULT OF HER IMPLANTATION SHE EXPERIENCED CHRONIC PAIN, BLEEDING, INCONTINENCE, DYSPAREUNIA, AND HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE INTERCOURSE SINCE 1998. SHE EXPRESSED TO HER PHYSICIAN THAT SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT DUE TO HER PREEXISTING DIAGNOSIS OF LUPUS THAT SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE CONSENTED TO HAVING THE MESH IMPLANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE PHYSICIAN PRESSURED HER THAT THIS TYPE OF PROCEDURE IS VERY COMMON. AFTER DOING RESEARCH OF HER OWN SHE FOUND THAT AT THAT TIME ""IT WAS FAIRLY NEW TO IMPLANT MESH VAGINALLY FOR BLADDER ISSUES."" SHE FINALLY DECIDED TO GO TO ANOTHER PHYSICIAN FOR A SECOND OPINION. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT SHE HAD GRANULOMA AND IN 2001 SHE HAD ""A LOT OF THE MESH REMOVED."" SHE CONTINUED TO HAVE WORSENING SYMPTOMS AND IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT SHE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL SURGERY IN 2003 BUT SHE DECLINED DUE TO HER CONCERN ABOUT LOSING HER JOB AND BENEFITS. ON (B)(6) 2012 SHE JUST ""COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE"" AND OPTED TO HAVE REVISION SURGERY. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT SHE HAD ""STONE LIKE FOREIGN BODY GROWTH"" ON THE MESH. THE GROWTH AND 40% OF THE SUTURES THAT EXTENDED FROM THE URETHRA THROUGH THE VAGINA WERE REMOVED. SHE CONTINUES TO HAVE PAIN, BLEEDING, INCONTINENCE, A DIMINISHED CAPACITY FOR QUALITY OF LIFE.

MY DOCTOR WAS (B)(6). THEY WANTED TO REPAIR MY RECURRENT HERNIA AND THEY PUT PROLENE MESH IN ME. AFTER SURGERIES I WENT BACK TO THE ROOM. THEY SAID EVERYTHING WENT WELL. THEN THE NEXT DAY I HAD A FEVER OF 103. THEY TOLD ME I HAD AN INFECTION. THAT DAY THEY STARTED RUNNING TESTS ON ME AND MY FEVER WOULD NOT GO DOWN, SO THIS WENT ON FOR ANOTHER WEEK. WHILE I WAS RUNNING A 103 FEVER, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BRING ME IN FOR SURGERY. THEY WERE AFRAID SOMETHING WAS WRONG, SO THEY DID THAT AND I WOKE UP WITH AN OSTOMY BAG AND THEY DID NOT TELL ME THAT THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME. I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THIS WAS. I FOUND OUT AFTER, THAT THE MESH BROKE INSIDE OF ME AND WENT TO MY FISTULA AND THAT'S HOW I HAD THE INFECTION. I STAYED IN THE HOSPITAL FOR A FEW MORE MONTHS, WENT HOME WITH THE OSTOMY ON. I HAD TO HAVE NURSES COME IN TWICE A DAY TO BANDAGE MY WOUNDS FROM BOTH SURGERIES. AFTER THE FIRST WEEK I WAS HOME, I BECAME REALLY DEPRESSED, WAS THINKING OF SUICIDE SO I WASN'T EATING ANYTHING. I LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT. I WAS (B)(6) WHEN I WENT INTO (B)(6). WHEN I WAS HOME, I WAS (B)(6). I ENDED UP HAVING KIDNEY FAILURE AND ALMOST DIED. MY MOM BROUGHT ME TO (B)(6) WHERE I SPENT A MONTH OR SO THERE. I ENDED UP GOING BACK HOME, STILL WITH NURSING UNTIL I WENT FOR SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2010. I GOT A REVERSAL OF THE OSTOMY AND I WAS FINE AFTER THAT , BUT A FEW MONTHS LATER I GOT MORE HERNIAS AND WENT TO ANOTHER DOCTOR BECAUSE I FIRED DR. (B)(6). I WENT TO DR. (B)(6) IN (B)(6). HE TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO EVER HAVE SURGERY AGAIN BECAUSE I HAVE NO MORE SCAR TISSUE OR STOMACH WALL LEFT TO OPERATE WITH NOW. I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THESE HERNIAS AND BE IN PAIN ALL THE TIME. THEY HAVE ME ON PAIN MEDICINE AND IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE OR UNTIL A HERNIA BURST AND I DIE. A FEW MONTHS AGO, I STARTED DOING RESEARCH ON THIS, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT (B)(4) WENT WRONG. I FIND IN MY PAST SURGERIES, THEY USED RECALLED MESH MARLEX AND I KEPT ON HAVING TO GO BACK FOR HERNIA REPAIRS. SO I AM TRYING TO GET A LAWYER SO I CAN SUE PROLENE FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND I CAN NEVER WORK AGAIN EVER OR LIFT ANYTHING ABOVE 20 LBS.",,,,1.0,2012/06/27,PROLENE 12X12,PROLENE MESH,,,,,,,,,,0HP,,PML,,BAE200,,N,,FTL,,,,,

I HAD BEEN MY MOTHER'S CAREGIVER, AND WAS NOW UNABLE TO RETURN TO HER BECAUSE I WAS SO ILL. WHEN THE DAY FINALLY APPROACHED THAT THE WOUND VAC THERAPY WOULD END, I ACTUALLY THOUGHT LIFE WOULD RESUME TO NORMAL. I WAS WRONG. JUST 6 WEEKS LATER, NEW SYMPTOMS DEVELOPED, I NOW HAD BLEEDING VAGINALLY, AND TREMENDOUS PAIN IN MY VAGINAL AREA. AFTER SEEKING AND FINDING A NEW GYNECOLOGIST, IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT I HAD A ""FISTULA"" IN THE VAGINAL CUFF, IT WOULD LATER BE DETERMINED THAT ""FISTULA"" WAS ACTUALLY AN AREA OF MESH EROSION.

THE AREA BETWEEN VAGINAL WALL AND RECTUM HAVE AN AREA THAT HAS ERODED ALL THE WAY THROUGH. NOW WHEN I ""PUSH"" TO HAVE A BOWEL MOVEMENT, MY VAGINAL AREA BECOMES FILLED WITH FECAL MATTER. SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS WHETHER OR NOT I AM STRAINING, AS JUST THIS MORNING I WAKE AGAIN WITH FECAL MATTER IN THIS AREA. I HAVE DIFFICULTY WALKING, MY LOWER SPINE AND HIPS HURT SO BADLY.

I WOULD BE GLAD TO SUBMIT MY ENTIRE MEDICAL RECORDS FOR REVIEW TO THE FDA IF YOU SHOULD REQUEST. I DO NOT BLAME THE FDA FOR ANY OF MY INJURIES.

A STUDY CONDUCTED BY DR (B)(6) MD, UNIVERSITY OF (B)(6) MEDICAL CENTER, HAS DONE JUST THAT.

THIS IS JUST ONE SUCH EXAMPLE, OF THE MANY MANY ARTICLES OF MEDICAL LITERATURE PUBLISHED ON THE USAGE AND EFFECTS OF SURGICAL MESH. ACCORDING TO ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION NUMBER 352, PUBLISHED DECEMBER 2006. ETHICAL GUIDELINES STATE ""WITHOUT ADEQUATE DATA ON THE RISK AND BENEFITS OF NEW TREATMENTS, PTS ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE A TRUE INFORMED CONSENT"", BY 1986 IT WAS KNOWN THAT POLYPROPYLENE DEGRADES IN THE HUMAN BODY. CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY REACTION, MACROPHAGES SECRETE ACIDIC COMPOUNDS, WHICH IN TURN CAUSE OXIDATION, THIS CAUSES THE DEGRADATION, CAUSING TOXIC COMPOUNDS, MESH SHRINKAGE, AND AN ENHANCED INFLAMMATORY REACTION. WHICH IN TURN CAUSES AN IMMUNE RESPONSE, THAT LEADS TO TOTAL MESH INFECTION, AND EROSION. WHERE COMPLICATIONS AND ADVERSE EVENTS ARE CONCERNED THEY ARE NOT LIMITED TO SURGICAL MESH PLACED ""TRANSVAGINALLY"", WHILE IT MAY APPEAR TRUE THAT THERE ARE MORE RISKS WITH THE TRANSVAGINAL APPROACH, THAT IDEA SHOULD BE EXAMINED WITH CAUTION. IN TODAY'S SURGICAL MARKET IT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD THAT MORE POP REPAIR SURGERIES ARE DONE WITH THE TRANSVAGINAL METHOD VS ABDOMINAL APPROACH. THAT FACTOR ALONE COULD BE THE REASON BEHIND MORE ADVERSE EVENTS BEING REPORTED FOR MESH PLACEMENT OF TRANSVAGINAL SURGERY. IF LESS ABDOMINAL PROCEDURES ARE DONE, HOW CAN THE COMPARISON BE MADE AND EXPECT TO RECEIVE TRUE STATISTICS? I CAN CERTAINLY TELL YOU, I HAD TO ENDURE JUST AS MANY IF NOT MORE INJURIES THAN THOSE LISTED FOR KNOWN RISK OF TRANSVAGINAL PLACEMENT OF SURGICAL MESH. ALSO THE MEDICAL WORLD SHOULD REALIZE THAT THESE ""ADVERSE EVENTS"", ""KNOWN RISK"" AND INJURIES ARE NOT UNIQUE TO SURGICAL MESH IMPLANTED TRANSVAGINALLY. IN AN ARTICLE TITLED ""MESH RELATED INFECTIONS AFTER HERNIA REPAIR"" CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION: VOLUME 11, ISSUE 1. TUFT UNIVERSITY OF BOSTON, PUBLISHED NOVEMBER, 2004. THE RATE OF INFECTION WITH HERNIA REPAIR WITH MESH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE AS HIGH AS 8%, THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT REGARDLESS OF THE ROUTE OF PLACEMENT, ONCE MESH IS IMPLANTED INTO THE HUMAN BODY, A CHAIN OF REACTIONS START TO TAKE PLACE. DURING A 2010 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF 100 EX PLANTS OF POLYPROPYLENE MESH, USED AS AN ENFORCEMENT FOR PELVIC SURGERY SHOWS POLYPROPYLENE SURGICAL MESH IS NOT INERT. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS. THE INJURIES TO PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY UNCALLED FOR. IS THE FDA AWARE THAT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICAN CITIZENS NOW THINK THAT THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN THE WAY FDA PROVIDES MARKETING APPROVAL FOR DRUGS AND DEVICES. I CAN ONLY PRAY THAT IS UNTRUE, TO KNOW THAT ""SAFETY"" COULD BE BROUGHT BY DEEP POCKETED DRUG/DEVICE MANUFACTURERS WOULD BE DEVASTATING. THESE TYPES ARE DEVICES ARE UNSAFE PERIOD. LOOK AT MESH USED FOR HERNIA REPAIR, SAME OUTCOME, SAME ADVERSE EVENTS. IT DOES NOT TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COMMON DENOMINATOR IS HERE. THE MATERIAL THE MESH IS MANUFACTURED FROM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EFFECTS OF POLYPROPYLENE ON THE HUMAN BODY IT IS CLEAR TO SEE, THIS MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE IN ANYTHING THAT IS INTENDED TO BE IMPLANTED IN THE HUMAN. BELOW YOU WILL FIND A LINK TO INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET. THIS IS A VIDEO FROM ALL TYPES OF PEOPLE THAT FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER HAVE HAD SURGICAL MESH IMPLANTED. NOTICE THEY ALL HAVE SAME ADVERSE EVENTS, SAME INJURIES, AND ALL OF THEM ARE SUFFERING NOW. I PLEAD WITH YOU TO PLEASE EXAMINE WHAT I AM SAYING HERE. TAKE THESE DEVICES OFF THE MARKET PLEASE, STOP DEVICES MADE FROM THE BIO MATERIALS. (WHICH POLYPROPYLENE) IS ACTUALLY A WASTE PRODUCT LEFTOVER FROM PETROLEUM BEING MANUFACTURED. ALSO I THINK THE CHAIN OF SUPPLY SHOULD BE EXAMINED FROM WHERE THE MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY PURCHASE THE PELLETS, OR POWDERED BIO MATERIALS OF POLYPROPYLENE THAT IS USED TO MAKE THESE DEVICES. THERE ARE ONLY A FEW MANUFACTURERS OF PETROLEUM IN THE WORLD, AND WHILE MANY OF THEM SELLS THE POLYPROPYLENE MATERIAL IN THE RAW, I AM UNABLE TO FIND ONE (1) THAT DOES NOT GIVE A DISCLAIMER THAT THESE MATERIALS ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE USED IN PRODUCTS OF MEDICAL DEVICES THAT WILL BE IN CONTACT WITH THE HUMAN BODY, TISSUES, OR FLUIDS. (B)(6). RIGHT NOW IN OUR NATION WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO SLOW THE GROWTH OF HEALTH CARE COST, HOW MUCH DO THINK DEFECTIVE DEVICES HAVE COST OUR NATION? MANY TIMES AFTER IMPLANT THESE PTS WILL NEED EXTENDED LONG TERM HEALTH CARE, MULTIPLE SURGERIES. EXTENDED HOSPITAL STAYS, AND REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH VERY COSTLY ANTI-BIOTICS. WHEN IT IS LOOKED AT LIKE THIS, ITS EASY TO REALIZE WHY HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS ARE SO COSTLY. IT IS A DOMINO EFFECT. TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COST OF LEGAL LITIGATION INVOLVED WITH DEFECTIVE DEVICES. SOMETHING NEEDS TO HAPPEN HERE, THIS IS TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. AS A CITIZEN WE COUNT ON OUR GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT US. THE EPA HAS LAWS RESTRICTING CERTAIN CHEMICALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT, YET THOSE LAWS ARE LACKING WHERE MEDICAL DEVICES ARE CONCERNED. I FEEL THE FIRST THING TO DO, WOULD BE TO IMPLEMENT A STUDY TO PROVE THE SAFETY OF THESE MATERIALS BEING USED TO MANUFACTURE THESE DEVICES FOR IMPLANT INTO THE HUMAN BODY. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE, THERE ARE CURRENTLY MANY DEVICES THAT ARE NOW INVOLVED IN LEGAL LITIGATION, AND WHAT DO THESE DEVICES HAVE IN COMMON? AGAIN THE MATERIAL USED TO MANUFACTURE THEM. IT IS CLEAR TO SEE, THIS MATERIAL HAS NOT PROVEN SAFE FOR ANY METHOD OF IMPLANT. I HAD MESH IMPLANTED TO CORRECT POP, MINE WAS DONE ABDOMINAL, LOOK AT HERNIA MESH PLACEMENT, ABDOMINAL PLACEMENT, SAME EXACT INJURIES, COMPLICATIONS. PROTECT US PLEASE. WE TRUST THE FDA TO KEEP US SAFE. I QUESTION IF THIS A VEHICLE THAT HAD CAUSED THIS AMOUNT OF HUMAN SUFFERING, YOU THINK IT WOULD NOT BE SUBJECTED TO A MANDATORY RECALL? WE KNOW IT WOULD. I WILL NOT REST UNTIL THIS MATTER IS LOOKED AT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT MY PLEA MADE HERE WILL NOT FALL ON DEAF EARS, AS NO ONE DESERVES TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN IN THEIR LIFE.

THE SURGEON REPORTED THAT THE MESH SCREEN HAD ADHERED ITSELF TO THE MUSCLES AND REMOVAL OF THE SCREEN WOULD REQUIRE LENGTHY AND DELICATE SURGERY. THE PT WAS TOLD TO TAKE OTC NSAIDS AND ""SEE HOW IT GOES TO WALK"". IT WAS NECESSARY TO USE A CANE FOR APPROX 5 MONTHS I AM THE PT AND AM STILL IN PAIN ONE YEAR POST-SURGERY.

THIS CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS INTESTINAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS BOWEL PERFORATION AND/OR CHRONIC INTESTINAL FISTULAE (ABNORMAL CONNECTIONS OR PASSAGEWAYS BETWEEN THE INTESTINES AND OTHER ORGANS). AFFECTED LOTS WERE RECALLED BETWEEN DECEMBER 2005 AND MARCH 2006. IN MARCH, THE FDA SENT A RECALL LETTER TO PHYSICIANS AND PTS ADVISING PTS IMPLANTED WITH ONE OF THE RECALLED LOT NUMBERS TO SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION IF THEY EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT OR UNEXPLAINED ABDOMINAL PAIN, FEVER, TENDERNESS AT THE IMPLANT SITE OR OTHER RELATED SYMPTOMS. PTS SHOULD ALSO CONTACT THEIR PHYSICIAN, IF THEY HAVE NOT DONE SO, FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. THIS RECALL IS PRODUCT CODE AND LOT SPECIFIC AND APPLIES TO THE LARGE SIZED PATCHES. I HAVE OTHER COPIES SO YOU MAY USE THESE. I BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT THEY USE IN ME. IT ALL ADDS UP ALSO IT IS A CLASS ACTION SUIT. I NEVER GOT PAID FOR IT. PLEASE TRY AND UNDERSTAND THAT I STILL NEED HELP AND I AM STILL HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY BOWEL. I BELIEVE THE BANDS BROKE AGAIN. I HAVE ALL THE SYMPTOMS. PLEASE HELP.

IN 2012, I DEVELOPED A BLADDER STONE WITH STONE FRAGMENTS ATTACHED TO MESH IN THE BLADDER. ON (B)(6) 2013, I HAD SURGERY TO REMOVE THE MESH AND STONE. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: TRANSVAGINALLY PLACED MESH IN BLADDER WITH LARGE ADHERENT BLADDER STONE. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: CYSTOSCOPY WITH CYSTOLITHOLAPAXY, LAPAROSCOPIC EXCISION AND REMOVAL OF INTRAVESICAL MESH. DISCUSSION: IS A (B)(6) FEMALE WHO HAS A DIAGNOSIS OF A LARGE BLADDER STONE ADHERENT TO A PIECE OF MESH THAT WAS THROUGH AND THROUGH THE BLADDER AT THE BLADDER NECK. AFTER A HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION WAS PERFORMED, POTENTIAL DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES WERE DISCUSSED WITH THE PATIENT. CYSTOSCOPIC AND LAPAROSCOPIC (INTRAVESICAL LAPAROSCOPY/CYSTOSCOPY THROUGH SP PLACED TROCHAR) WAS RECOMMENDED AND A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS, POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS, POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS, ALONG WITH THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS WERE REVIEWED. SHE WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS. ONCE ANSWERED, INFORMED CONSENT WAS OBTAINED. SHE WAS BROUGHT TO THE OPERATING ON (B)(6) 2013 PROCEDURE. PROCEDURE: (B)(6) WAS BROUGHT TO THE OPERATING ROOM AND PLACED SUPINE ON THE CYSTOSCOPY TABLE. AFTER INITIATION OF SPINAL ANESTHESIA. SHE WAS PLACED IN A DORSAL LITHOTOMY POSITION AND THE GROIN WERE PREPPED AND SHE WAS DRAPED IN THE STANDARD FASHION FOR CYSTOSCOPY. A 22 FRENCH CYSTOSCOPE WAS PASSED PER URETHRA AND THE BLADDER STONE WITH UNDERLYING SLING MESH MATERIAL WAS SEEN. THIS WAS AT THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE BLADDER NECK AND THE TRIGONE ON THE LEFT. THERE WAS SOME MODERATE BLEEDING AROUND THE MESH AS IT WAS MANIPULATED WITH A GRASPER THROUGH THE CYSTOSCOPE IN ORDER TO GET A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT WE WERE DEALING WITH. USING THE CYSTOSCOPE AS A GUIDE, A 5 MM SCREW PORT WAS PLACED THROUGH A SMALL SKIN INCISION JUST ABOVE THE PUBIC SYMPHYSIS ON THE RIGHT. THROUGH THIS PORT A GRASPER WAS PASSED AND THE MESH GRASPED AND LIFTED. INITIALLY THE STONE WAS BROKEN UP AND KNOCKED OFF THE MESH BETTER EXPOSING IT. THE LARGE STONE PIECES WERE LEFT IN THE BLADDER FOR REMOVAL AT THE END OF THE PROCEDURE. THE LENGTH OF MESH COVERED WITH STONE WAS ABOUT 3-4 CM. WITH THE MESH LIFTED, I INITIALLY TRIED TO CUT THE MESH AT THE BLADDER MUCOSA USING A SCISSOR THROUGH THE CYSTOSCOPE. THE MESH WAS TOO TOUGH TO CUT WITH SUCH A SMALL SCISSOR. I THEN PASSED A 500 LASER FIBER AND, DIRECTING IT WITH A PIECE OF A URETERAL CATHETER, I WAS ABLE TO CUT THE SMALL FIBERS OF THE MESH AT THE LEVEL OF THE MUCOSA. THIS WAS A TEDIOUS PROCESS AND TOOK OVER AN HOUR. WE WERE IRRIGATING THROUGH THE CYSTOSCOPE WITH THE FLUID EXITING THROUGH THE LAPAROSCOPIC SCREW PORT BUT, DURING THIS EXTENDED EXCISION PROCESS, THERE WAS SOME FLUID WHICH EXTRAVASATED, EXTRA-PERITONEAL, AROUND THE BLADDER. ALSO, DURING THE MESH EXCISION, THE LEFT URETERAL ORIFICE WAS SEEN AND WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE SLING MATERIAL THAT I DETERMINED TO LEAVE A STENT. THE LARGE STONE FRAGMENTS WERE BROKEN USING THE LASER INTO SMALL ENOUGH PIECES TO BE IRRIGATED THROUGH THE CYSTOSCOPE. ONCE ALL THE STONE PIECES WERE REMOVED, A DUAL-FLEX WIRE WAS DIRECTED UP THE LEFT URETER AND THE SCOPE WAS THEN REMOVED LEAVING THE WIRE INDWELLING. A 4.8 FRENCH STENT WAS PASSED OVER THE WIRE AND THEN THE WIRE WAS REMOVED. THE DISTAL COIL WAS VISUALIZED DIRECTLY WITH THE CYSTOSCOPE AND WAS IN GOOD POSITION. THE LAPAROSCOPIC PORT WAS THEN REMOVED. MUCH OF THE EXTRAVASATED FLUID WAS EXPRESSED THROUGH THE SKIN INCISION AND THEN A SMALL, 1/4"" PENROSE DRAIN WAS PLACED THROUGH THE INCISION TO HELP DRAIN ANY REMAINING FLUID. THIS WAS STITCHED IN PLACE WITH A 3-0 NYLON. A FOLEY WAS THEN PLACED AND LEFT TO GRAVITY DRAINAGE WHERE LIGHT PINK URINE WAS RETURNING. (B)(6) WAS THEN AWAKENED IN THE OPERATING ROOM AFTER BEING TAKEN OUT OF LITHOTOMY POSITION. THE PATIENT WAS THEN TRANSFERRED FROM THE TABLE TO THE STRETCHER AND THEN TO THE PACU IN STABLE CONDITION. (B)(6) TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL AND THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: SYMPTOMATIC CYSTOCELE AND STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE.

I WAS VIOLATED ON THE HIGHEST LEVEL IMAGINABLE, AND THEN HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING RIPPED OFF FOR COMPENSATION THAT IS DUE TO MYSELF AND MY FAMILY, BY PEOPLE I AM SUPPOSED TO TRUST TO HANDLE MY CASE AND IN AUTHORITY. I'VE TRIED TO HANDLE MY CASE MYSELF HOWEVER TO NO AVAIL. EVERYONE INVOLVED IN WHOLE OR PART OF DOING WRONG, NEEDS TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

I AWOKE TO PROCEDURES THAT WEREN'T EVEN DISCUSSED OR AUTHORIZED. AND LATER LEARNED THAT I WAS BEING USED FOR TRAINING PURPOSES WITHOUT CONSENT OR CONSIDERATION FOR MY FAMILY OR MY OWN NEEDS. SIX MONTHS LATER, I LEARNED THAT THE RECTAL PROCEDURE WAS NOT APPROVED BY THE FDA. I LEARNED THAT THE MANUFACTURING COMPANY WAS IN THE OPERATING ROOM AS WELL. TO MY KNOWLEDGE, THERE WOULD ONLY BE TWO DOCTORS, ONE TO ASSIST THE OTHER, AND IT WAS A SIMPLE PROCEDURE THAT WOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH MY LIFE. FORCED TO BE A PRO-SE AND TO HAVE MY CASE DISMISSED DUE TO THE FACT THAT HERE IN (B)(6) DOCTORS DO NOT GO AGAINST DOCTORS AND NOR DO THE ATTORNEY'S. ALSO NOT HAVING THE FUNDS TO PAY FOR OUT OF STATE HELP. EVEN THOUGH I HAVE HARD EVIDENCE, PICTURES OF MY VAGINA AFTER SURGERY, HIPAA FORM AND MY MEDICAL RECORDS. THAT SHOWS A 45MIN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT WAS DONE. AND WHY WHAT WAS AGREED UPON WASN'T DONE, AND WHY WASN'T MY HUSBAND MADE AWARE WHEN I CODED AND CHANGE IN MY PROCEDURE. WITH DRAWN PICTURES FROM THE PHYSICIAN, ALSO PESSARY USE NUMBER 5 JUST RIGHT NUMBER 7 TOO BIG AND A NEVER PLACED NUMBER 6, IN THAT ORDER. WITH NO NEED FOR SUCH DRASTIC MEASURES THAT WERE TAKEN. THAT CAUSED MORE HARM THAN GOOD. ALSO A PROMISE PAMPHLET OF THE HOSPITAL STATING MY RIGHTS AND PROPER PROCEEDINGS, WHICH WAS NOT GIVEN OR EVEN FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO STOP THIS TYPE OF ABUSE OF AUTHORITY. I WAS VIOLATED ON THE HIGHEST LEVEL IMAGINABLE, UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY TO MY VAGINAL WALLS AND RECTUM! I FEAR FOR THE CHILDREN AND PUBLIC IN THE FUTURE AND WHAT WILL BE DONE TO THEM WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE.

I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE, BEFORE I FOUND HELP. THIS LOT NUMBER SHOULD BE RECALLED. ON (B)(6) 2011, I HAD INGUINAL SURGERY AND A MESH CALLED PROLENE WAS PLACED INSIDE ME. THIS WAS MADE BY ETHICON WHICH WAS USED IN THE SURGERY. THREE DAYS AFTER SURGERY A SMALL AREA AT THE END OF THE MESH STARTED BURNING AND ITCHING. AT THIS TIME, I BELIEVED ITCHING WAS PART OF THE HEALING PROCESS. HOWEVER, THIS WENT ON TOO LONG. I MADE A VISIT TO MY SURGEON WHO TOLD ME THE ITCHING WAS DUE TO A POSSIBLE TORN LIGAMENT AND SAID TO GIVE IT TIME TO HEAL. BY (B)(6) I WAS RUNNING A LOW GRADE FEVER. I WAS GETTING WEAKER AND FELT LIKE I HAD FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS. THE FEVER AND FLU SYMPTOMS STAYED WITH ME FOR NINE MONTHS. SEVERE BURNING AND ITCHING SLOWLY MOVED ACROSS THE AREA WHERE MY MESH WAS PLACED. BY (B)(6) 2011, I HAD SOME PRESSURE UNDER IT. ONCE AGAIN, I WAS VERY ILL FOR THREE WEEKS. I SUDDENLY REALIZED THE SEVERE ITCHING WASN'T A HEALING ITCH. I KNEW MY BODY WAS REJECTING THIS FOREIGN OBJECT PLACED IN MY BODY. I WENT FOR A VISIT TO MY SURGEON, BUT FOUND THAT HE HAD A STROKE AND CLOSED HIS PRACTICE. I HAD SEVERE BLADDER INFECTIONS. THE MESH CREATED INFLAMMATION, PUTTING SEVERE PRESSURE ON MY BLADDER AND AGGRAVATED IT. BY (B)(6), MY FEVER BROKE AND MY BODY WAS VERY WEAK. THEN, FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, I FELT AS IF A KNIFE WAS STABBING ME ON MY RIGHT SIDE OF MY ABDOMEN. THE SEVERE BURNING AND ITCHING SENSATION BEGAN TO SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ENTIRE INSIDE OF MY BODY. AT FIRST, I HAD A MILD BURNING IN MY MOUTH AND LIPS. MY BODY WAS IN SEVERE STRESS AND SHOCK. I MADE MORE TRIPS TO THE ER, PAIN PILLS DIDN'T HELP. DURING THE LAST SIX MONTHS, I MADE 12 VISITS TO DIFFERENT DOCTORS. THREE DOCTORS WERE HERNIA SPECIALISTS. IT WAS TOLD BY TWO THEY COULD SEE NO NEED FOR SURGERY. DR (B)(6) WAS MOST HELPFUL BY RUNNING VARIOUS TESTS, WHICH WERE USED AT A LATER DATE. TRAVELING IN THE CAR, DOCTOR TO DOCTOR, WAS VERY PAINFUL. THE SEVERE BURNING INSIDE MY BODY WOULD BURN 24 HOURS A DAY. MY TONGUE WOULD FEEL LIKE IT WAS CATCHING ON FIRE. MY LIPS WOULD SWELL AND THE INSIDE OF MY NOSE AND EARS WOULD BURN. MY CHEEKS BURNED 24 HOURS AND MY THROAT WAS BROKEN OUT WITH HIVES 80% OF THE TIME. WHEN A DOCTOR WOULD TRY DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS, I WOULD REALLY FIGHT A BATTLE. AFTER ONE PARTICULAR PILL, ALL OF THE BURNING AND ITCHING WOULD ONLY INTENSIFY EVEN MORE. THE LAST SIX MONTHS, I WAS BEDFAST. I COULDN'T WATCH TV BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE BURNING AND ITCHING IN MY EYES. ALMOST 80% OF THE TIME I COULDN'T TALK ON THE PHONE, BECAUSE MY THROAT WAS MOSTLY SWOLLEN SHUT AND MY EARS WOULD HAVE A CONSTANT BURNING. IT WAS ALSO DIFFICULT TO TALK WHEN MY LIPS WERE SWOLLEN AND MY TONGUE FELT AS IF IT WAS ON FIRE. I KEPT ICE CHIPS BY MY BED AND WOULD PACK MY BODY WITH DAMP TOWELS. I HAD ICE PACKS FOR MY CHEEKS AND LIPS. I USED AN ELECTRIC BLANKET DAILY TO HELP GIVE ME SOME RELIEF SO THAT I COULD SLEEP. I FELT EACH DAY DEATH WAS NEAR. GOING TO TWELVE DOCTORS AND RECEIVING NO HELP, I CRIED DAILY. FINALLY, A PAIN MGMT DOCTOR TOLD ME HE COULDN'T BE OF HELP. HE STATED TO ME THAT I HAD A MESH PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THE SYMPTOMS I HAD. HE TOLD ME TO GET OUT OF (B)(6) TO FIND PROPER CARE. ON (B)(6), I HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH DR (B)(6), WHO IS A TRAUMA/CRITICAL CARE SURGEON AT (B)(6). HE WAS TRULY HELPFUL AND LISTENED TO MY SYMPTOMS. AFTER HE REVIEWED MY FILE, HE SAID THAT I WAS IN CRITICAL CONDITION AND THAT HE WANTED TO PERFORM SURGERY THE NEXT DAY, WHICH WAS (B)(6). AFTER SURGERY, IT FELT LIKE A MIRACLE HAD BEEN PERFORMED. THE BURNING SENSATION THROUGHOUT MY BODY WAS GONE. IT LATER TOOK ABOUT A MONTH AFTER SURGERY FOR THE ITCHING TO COMPLETELY LEAVE MY BODY. AFTER THIS, I STILL SUFFER. I HAVE NOTICED MY HANDWRITING IS NOT THE SAME AND WHEN I LAY DOWN, MY RIGHT LEG WILL ONLY RAISE UP TO 3"". A PRICE IS HARD TO PLACE ON ONE'S LIFE. NOT ONLY WAS I FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE, MY FAMILY MISSED ALL THE HOLIDAYS FOR 18 MONTHS IN MY HOME. I WASN'T ABLE TO VISIT THEIR HOMES, DUE TO MY MESH PROBLEM. (B)(6) ARE MY CHILDREN AND YOU'LL SEE APPOINTMENTS MADE BY THEM ON MY RECORDS. YOU HAVE RECORDS ON ALL DOCTORS, BUT FOLLOWING: DR (B)(6) (AN INFECTION DOCTOR), HE FOUND NO INFECTION IN MY BODY. (B)(6) (NEUROLOGIST), FOUND NO PROBLEMS IN MY WALKING, TURNING AND ETC. DR (B)(6) (AN ALLERGY DR), WANTED ME TO GET SOME OF THE MESH AND TEST IT ON ME. HE HAD NO LUCK AND I DIDN'T EITHER. DR (B)(6) A HERNIA SPECIALIST), ABOUT A FIVE MIN VISIT, STATED, TOO, I DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER HERNIA, AND I KNEW THAT, AND STATED NO NEED FOR SURGERY. DR (B)(6) (A HERNIA SPECIALIST) ONCE AGAIN STATED NO REASON FOR SURGERY. I ASK HIM IF HE EVER HAD A PT THAT SEVERELY BURNED INSIDE THEIR BODY. COMMENTED BACK, ""UNHEARD OF."" (B)(6), HE DID MAKE A SHORT REMARK AND IT IS ATTACHED AND IS HARD TO READ. HE HAD ALL MY MEDICAL REPORTS AND STATED TOO THAT HE COULDN'T HELP. I HAD A SERIOUS MESH PROBLEM AND NEEDED TO HAVE SURGERY. SUGGESTED (B)(6), ONE WEEK LATER, SURGERY WAS PERFORMED AND WHEN I WOKE-UP, THE SEVERE BURNING WAS GONE.

THE DOCTOR NEVER SAID IT COULD BE THE MESH, HE ONLY SAID I WOULD NEVER HAVE ANOTHER HERNIA. THE PAIN INCREASED UNTIL I HAD A NERVE DISSECTION ON (B)(6) 2003 TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.

I STILL DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THE MESH. SAW ADS ON TV ABOUT VAGINAL MESH AND BEGAN TO WONDER IF IT WAS MY MESH CAUSING ALL THE PROBLEMS. I WENT TO 2 DIFFERENT DOCTORS WHO WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER THE MESH AND MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS JUST IMAGING A PAIN THAT HURT TO SIT, GO TO THE BATHROOM, WALK ACROSS THE ROOM, GET OUT OF A CHAIR! I FINALLY FOUND A DOCTOR WHO KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPERIENCING AND KNEW THAT INDEED IT WAS THE MESH. HAD SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2013 TO REMOVE MESH FROM MY LEFT SIDE. UNFORTUNATELY AFTER AN OPERATION THAT LASTED OVER 2 HOURS, HE WASN'T ABLE TO GET ALL THE MESH OUT AS IT HAD ERODED INTO MY TISSUES! THERE WASN'T ANY GUARANTEE I WOULD BE PAIN FREE. AFTER ALMOST A YEAR, THOUGH BETTER, I'M STILL NOT PAIN FREE AND CONTINUE TO GET THE FEELING OF BEING KICKED IN MY TESTICLES! I STILL HAVE THE MESH IN MY RIGHT SIDE AND REALIZE IT IS JUST A TIME BOMB WAITING TO GO OFF AS THE MESH CONTINUES TO ERODE INTO MY TISSUES. IT COST ME ABOUT (B)(6), OUT OF MY OWN POCKET TO HAVE THE MESH REMOVED AS I DON'T HAVE ANY INSURANCE. I KNOW THERE ARE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED BECAUSE OF THE USE OF THE MESH AND YET THERE ISN'T ANYONE WHO WANTS TO HELP GET ME COMPENSATED FOR THE HORRIBLE PAIN AND SUFFERING I HAVE EXPERIENCED. WHAT'S MORE I CAN'T EVEN FIND OUT WHERE THE MESH WAS MANUFACTURED AS IT WAS DISTRIBUTED FROM (B)(6). FOR ALL I KNOW IT WAS COUNTERFEIT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE FDA OR MANUFACTURERS OR THE ATTORNEYS WHO DON'T SEEM TO CARE OR WANT TO HELP THE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AND ARE SUFFERING FROM A PRODUCT THAT A DOCTOR SHOULD WARN YOU ABOUT SO A PERSON CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON WHAT THEY WANT PUT IN THEIR BODY. ALL I GOT FROM THE DOCTOR WAS ""I'VE DONE 115 OF THESE OPERATIONS WITH NO PROBLEMS AND YOU'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER HERNIA."" THAT ENTIRE STATEMENT WAS FALSE. EVEN MY ORIGINAL DOCTOR, WHO PUT THE MESH IN, WON'T TALK ABOUT IT WITH ME, THOUGH I'VE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO CONTACT HIM.

I FINALLY GAVE UP GOING TO THE DOCTORS AND LEARNED TO LIVE WITH THE PAIN. THEN IN THE SUMMER OF 2012 THE PAIN CAME BACK WITH A FEELING THAT I HAD ANOTHER HERNIA, FEELING LIKE I HAD BEEN KICKED IN THE TESTICLES ALL THE TIME. IT BECAME DEBILITATING BY WINTER. I STILL DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THE MESH. SAW ADS ON TV ABOUT VAGINAL MESH AND BEGAN TO WONDER IF IT WAS MY MESH CAUSING ALL THE PROBLEMS. I WENT TO 2 DIFFERENT DOCTORS WHO WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER THE MESH AND MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS JUST IMAGING A PAIN THAT HURT TO SIT, GO TO THE BATHROOM, WALK ACROSS THE ROOM, GET OUT OF A CHAIR! I FINALLY FOUND A DOCTOR WHO KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPERIENCING AND KNEW THAT INDEED IT WAS THE MESH. HAD SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2013 TO REMOVE MESH FROM MY LEFT SIDE. UNFORTUNATELY AFTER AN OPERATION THAT LASTED OVER 2 HOURS, HE WASN'T ABLE TO GET ALL THE MESH OUT AS IT HAD ERODED INTO MY TISSUES! THERE WASN'T ANY GUARANTEE I WOULD BE PAIN FREE. AFTER ALMOST A YEAR, THOUGH BETTER, I'M STILL NOT PAIN FREE AND CONTINUE TO GET THE FEELING OF BEING KICKED IN MY TESTICLES! I STILL HAVE THE MESH IN MY RIGHT SIDE AND REALIZE IT IS JUST A TIME BOMB WAITING TO GO OFF AS THE MESH CONTINUES TO ERODE INTO MY TISSUES. IT COST ME ABOUT (B)(6), OUT OF MY OWN POCKET TO HAVE THE MESH REMOVED AS I DON'T HAVE ANY INSURANCE. I KNOW THERE ARE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED BECAUSE OF THE USE OF THE MESH AND YET THERE ISN'T ANYONE WHO WANTS TO HELP GET ME COMPENSATED FOR THE HORRIBLE PAIN AND SUFFERING I HAVE EXPERIENCED. WHAT'S MORE I CAN'T EVEN FIND OUT WHERE THE MESH WAS MANUFACTURED AS IT WAS DISTRIBUTED FROM (B)(6). FOR ALL I KNOW IT WAS COUNTERFEIT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE FDA OR MANUFACTURERS OR THE ATTORNEYS WHO DON'T SEEM TO CARE OR WANT TO HELP THE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AND ARE SUFFERING FROM A PRODUCT THAT A DOCTOR SHOULD WARN YOU ABOUT SO A PERSON CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON WHAT THEY WANT PUT IN THEIR BODY. ALL I GOT FROM THE DOCTOR WAS ""I'VE DONE 115 OF THESE OPERATIONS WITH NO PROBLEMS AND YOU'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER HERNIA."" THAT ENTIRE STATEMENT WAS FALSE. EVEN MY ORIGINAL DOCTOR, WHO PUT THE MESH IN, WON'T TALK ABOUT IT WITH ME, THOUGH I'VE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO CONTACT HIM. THE FDA NEEDS TO STEP INTO AT LEAST MAKE DOCTORS TELL THEIR PATIENTS THE RISKS AND LIFE LONG COMPLICATIONS AND PAIN THAT WILL NEVER BE OVER!

HE ALSO ADVISED ME THAT A HERNIA SURGERY WAS NECESSARY DUE TO DANGERS OF INTESTINAL STRANGULATION, BOWEL AND ORGAN OBSTRUCTION. THE HERNIA SURGERY WAS PERFORMED AND THE GORE-TEX DUAL MESH IMPLANT WAS USED.

AFTER SURGERY, MY HUSBAND SUFFERED AGONIZING PAIN FOR OVER A MONTH. SAW DOCTOR ON (B)(6) 2012 REGARDING PAIN AND STAPLES REMOVED. DOCTOR GAVE PAIN MEDS. ON (B)(6) 2012 I HAD TO RUSH MY HUSBAND TO THE HOSPITAL, THE PAIN WAS SO SEVERE; DOCTOR WAS OUT OF TOWN. A CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST WAS DONE, AND BLOOD WORK, HIS DOCTOR WAS SENT COPIES OF REPORTS. CT REPORTED INFLAMMATORY CHANGE IN THE SUBCUTANEOUS FAT ANTERIOR TO THE RIGHT INGUINAL AREA AND SOME SOFT TISSUE DENSITY ON THE INTRAABDOMINAL ASPECT OF THE RIGHT INGUINAL CANAL. SAID LIKELY HEMATOMA OR INFLAMMATORY REACTION IN THE MESENTERY RELATED TO HERNIA REPAIR. NO DEFINITE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST ABSCESS. SOFT TISSUE DENSITY NEAR THE INGUINAL CANAL MEASURES 3X3 CM. DOES NOT HAVE AN APPEARANCE OF BOWEL BUT COULD REPRESENT COMPONENTS OF THE INGUINAL CANAL SUCH AS THE SPERMATIC CORD OR COULD BE AN UNUSUAL HEMATOMA. CORRELATION WITH DETAILS OF THE SURGERY IS RECOMMENDED. ON (B)(6) 2012 VISIT TO DOCTOR AGAIN REGARDING SEVERE PAIN CONTINUOUS. DOCTOR PUT HIM ON NEURONTIN, ROBAXIN AND PERCOCET TO BE RECHECKED IS FURTHER PROBLEMS IN 8 WEEKS. ON (B)(6) 2012, MY HUSBAND AND I , WENT TO (B)(6) FOR AN OVERNIGHT VISIT WITH FRIENDS AS MY HUSBAND WAS FEELING BETTER. THE MORNING OF (B)(6) 2012, I WOKE UP AND FOUND MY HUSBAND NOT BREATHING, TOTALLY UNRESPONSIVE, EYES ROLLED BACK INTO HIS HEAD, AND A PROFUSE AMOUNT OF GRAY MUCUS COMING FORM HIS MOUTH. NINE ONE ONE CALLED IMMEDIATELY, THE PARAMEDIC'S AMBULANCE ARRIVED A FEW MINUTES LATER. THE PARAMEDICS BELIEVED HE WAS HAVING A STROKE. THEY IN TURN CALLED IN (B)(6) TO TRANSPORT HIM TO (B)(6) HOSPITAL IN (B)(6). THE PARAMEDICS INTUBATED (B)(6) AND TURNED HIM OVER TO (B)(6). MY FRIENDS DROVE ME TO THE HOSPITAL AND ARRIVED ABOUT 45 MINUTES LATER. THE EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN LET ME SEE (B)(6) BRIEFLY (STILL UNCONSCIOUS), AND HE EXPLAINED THEY HAD DONE A CT SCAN AND SAID THERE WAS NO BLOOD CLOT IN THE BRAIN BUT HE WAS SEPTIC, HAD PNEUMONIA, ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE, RENAL FAILURE AND THEY WERE TAKING HIM TO ICU IMMEDIATELY. AFTER DAYS OF TESTS I WAS TOLD BY ONE OF THE DOCTORS THAT HE HAD C-DIFFICILE, WHICH WAS THE ROOT CAUSE. A POSTING WAS PLACED ON HIS ICU ROOM ""C-DIFF PT"" AND FAMILY HAD TO WEAR HOSPITAL GLOVES AND GOWNS TO ENTER HIS ROOM AND THEN DISPOSE OF LEAVING. HE WAS IN THE ICU APPROX. 2 WEEKS BEFORE HIS INTUBATION TUBE AND VENTILATOR WERE REMOVED AND THEN HE WAS MOVED TO THE CARDIAC CARE UNIT (CCU). ONCE IN CCU, MY FAMILY AND I COULD OBSERVE HIS EXTREME DIFFICULTY TO TALK AND INABILITY TO TALK AND SEVERE TREMORS. HE WAS ALSO HAVING EXTREME DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HE WAS HAVING ASPIRATION PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH T HE DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING. SURGERY WAS REQUIRED TO PLACE A PEG FEEDING TUBE. ON (B)(6) 2012, (B)(6) WAS STABLE ENOUGH FOR THE DOCTORS TO RELEASE HIM FROM THE HOSPITAL TO A REHAB FACILITY. HE WAS TAKEN BY AMBULANCE FROM (B64 )HOSPITAL, (B)(6) REHAB CARE, (B)(6). LESS THAN A WEEK LATER HE WAS MOVED WHEN AN OPINING HAD BECOME AVAILABLE TO REHAB IN (B)(6) JUST 1-1/2 MILES FROM OUR HOME. HE WAS DISCHARGED FROM (B)(6) 2012 AND CAME HOME. TO GO HOME HE REQUIRES A WHEELCHAIR, OXYGEN, AND ENTERAL FEEDING KIT/PUMP, FEEDING FORMULA, ETC. IN (B)(6) 2013 HE HAD THE FEEDING TUBE REMOVED. THREE DAYS AFTER BEING DISCHARGED FROM REHAB. WE WENT TO SEE HIS PRIMARY DOCTOR ONCE WE WERE HOME TOGETHER, (B)(6) WAS GETTING VERY CONFUSED, NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS, AND DIFFICULTY RECOGNIZING ME AS HIS WIFE. AFTER SEEING DR (B)(6) OVER TIME CONTINUED TO HAVE CONFUSION. ON (B)(6) 2012, (B)(6) WOKE UP AND WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK COHERENTLY, AND WAS IN A GREAT STATE OF CONFUSION. OUR SON WAS VISITING AT THE TIME, AND WE WERE VERY CONCERNED THAT HE WAS HAVING A STROKE. SO WE TOOK HIM IMMEDIATELY TO (B)(6) HOSPITAL HERE IN (B)(6).

I HAD A PROLAPSED BLADDER AS WELL AS SUI, I HAD ALMOST IMMEDIATE DISCOMFORT, BUT THE DOCTOR ATTRIBUTED THIS TO OTHER CAUSES. EIGHT WEEKS LATER, THE PAIN WAS SO BAD I WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL FOR IV PAIN CONTROL, WHICH BARELY HELPED. WHILE THERE, DOCTORS DID EXPLORATORY SURGERY TO LOOK AT MY MESH, WHICH THEY SAID LOOKED FINE. PAIN CONTINUED TO WORSEN. I COULD NOT SIT AT ALL, STAND FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE, WALK AT ALL. I HAD TO SELF-CATHETERIZE AS I COULD NOT URINATE ON MY ONE. IT FELT LIKE I HAD A BRILLOW PAD IN MY VAGINA AND A CLAMP ON MY URETHRA. BY 4 MONTHS POST-IMPLANT, I WAS BEDRIDDEN WITH PAIN, I WAS GETTING WEAKER, AND MY FAMILY DOCTOR WORRIED I WOULD DIE. MY HUSBAND FINALLY FOUND A SURGEON WHO WOULD REMOVE THE MESH. HE DID SO 5 MONTHS POST IMPLANT. MY URETHRAL PAIN IMMEDIATELY SUBSIDED, AND I COULD URINATE NORMALLY AGAIN. I STILL HAD VAGINAL PAIN, HOWEVER. I WENT TO A PHYSICAL THERAPIST, WHO DIAGNOSED THAT MY PELVIC MUSCLES HAD GONE INTO SPASM (LIKE A CHARLIE HORSE). THE TIGHTEST POINT WAS WHERE THE MESH HAD BEEN ATTACHED, THUS THE PT DETERMINED MESH WAS THE CAUSE OF THE PELVIC MUSCLE PROBLEMS. SEVEN MONTHS OF INTERNAL PHYSICAL THERAPY, MULTIPLE WEEKLY NERVE BLOCKS BY A PAIN SPECIALIST, AND 7 DIFFERENT PAIN MEDICATIONS FINALLY GOT ME TO THE POINT WHERE MY PELVIC MUSCLES LOOSENED AGAIN, PEELING AWAY ANOTHER LAYER OF THIS PAIN. IV AS THEN LEFT WITH BURNING, STINGING, SHARP PAIN ON ONE SIDE OF MY VAGINAL WALL. MY PAIN DOCTOR DIAGNOSED A VULVA NEUROMA. I HAD THIS SURGICALLY REMOVED (SURGERY #4) 12 MONTHS AFTER THE INITIAL IMPLANT. I HAD TO GO BACK TO PHYSICAL THERAPY TO LOOSEN THE PELVIC MUSCLES AGAIN. FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE NEUROMA REMOVAL, I HAD GRANULATION TISSUE GROW THROUGH THE INCISION, WHICH HAD TO BE SURGICALLY REMOVED (SURGERY #5). AFTER THAT, I STILL HAD SOME VAGINAL PAIN/SWELLING AND COULD STILL NOT SIT OR HAVE SEX. ANOTHER SURGEON DIAGNOSED ""PELVIC CONGESTION SYNDROME"" WHICH IS PUFFY, SWOLLEN, PAINFUL, VARICOSE VEINS IN THE VULVA. I HAVE HAD 2 MORE SURGERIES TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THOSE (SURGERIES #6, #7). AS OF THIS WRITING, I AM STILL UNABLE TO SIT OR HAVE SEX, UNABLE TO WORK, UNABLE TO STAND FOR MORE THAN 30 MINUTES. I AM STILL IN PAIN, BAD ENOUGH TO BE ON SOME PAIN MEDICATIONS, BUT NOT AS BAD AS WITH THE MESH IN PLACE. THIS HORRIBLE PRODUCT HAS TURNED MINE AND MY FAMILY'S LIFE UPSIDE DOWN OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS. IT CAUSED HUGE AMOUNTS OF SUFFERING, PAIN, AND LOSS. I DO NOT KNOW IF I WILL EVER BE ABLE TO SIT, HAVE SEX, OR WORK AGAIN - AND I AM ONLY (B)(6) YEARS OLD. I WAS TOLD I WAS ""THE HEALTHIEST PT"" MY UROLOGIST HAD EVER IMPLANTED MESH INTO IN HIS CAREER. I HAD NOT PRIOR HEALTH PROBLEMS, WAS FIT AND ACTIVE. I HAVE 4 CHILDREN AND A HUSBAND WHO HAVE LOST THE WIFE/MOM THEY KNEW BEFORE. THIS PRODUCT MUST BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET UNTIL IT CAN BE PROPERLY TESTED. DOCTORS MUST BE FORCED TO WARN PTS ABOUT THE RISKS, BECAUSE I WAS NOT WARNED.

MY GYNECOLOGIST AT THAT TIME INFORMED ME OF THE PROBLEM OF THE TRANSVAGINAL MESH AND EXPLAINED TO ME THAT SURGICAL REMOVAL MAY BE NECESSARY IF SYMPTOMS WORSEN OR PERSIST. SINCE THAT VISIT I HAVE CONTINUED TO HAVE PAIN AND APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS LATER, I BEGAN TO HAVE A FOUL SMELLING DISCHARGE. I WAS PLACED ON A ANTIFUNGAL WHICH HELPED. FREQUENTLY AFTER HAVING MORE THAN ONE SEXUAL ENCOUNTER WITH MY SAME PARTNER DURING A WEEK PERIOD I DEVELOPED THIS ODOR AND DISCHARGE AS WELL AS EVEN GREATER PAIN. BECAUSE OF THIS I REFRAIN FROM INTERCOURSE DUE TO THE PAIN AND HUMILIATION. MY RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN IMPACTED WITH MY PARTNER. AT MY LAST YEARLY CHECK-UP WITH MY GYNECOLOGIST, I INFORMED HIM OF MY PAIN AND FRUSTRATION. AT THAT TIME MY GYNECOLOGIST EXAMINED ME AND HE STATED THAT HE COULD FEEL AN AREA THAT SEEMED TO BE SOME TYPE OF SCAR TISSUE OR SOME EROSION. MY GYNECOLOGIST OFFERED TO TRY TO REMOVE IT OR REPAIR IT FOR ME. I DECLINED BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE SURGICAL PROCEDURE AND I DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO PAY MY COPAY OR COINSURANCE AT THIS TIME.",,,,1.0,2014/06/09,TRANSVAGINAL MESH,MESH,BARD,,,,,,,,,0HP,,ATTORNEY HAS THAT INFO,SEE PREVIOUS,SEE PREVIOUS,SEE PREVIOUS,,,OTN,,,,,

ON (B)(6) 2012 - I HAD LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY REPAIR OF A VENTRAL HERNIA, WITH BARD-DAVOL VENTRALEX ST HERNIA PATCH MESH SCREEN WITH ABSORBABLE TACKS COVERING A SMALL LINEAR TEAR (2006 OPERATION INCISION FOR AN INGUINAL HERNIA), DESCRIBED BY THE SURGEON AS THE SIZE OF A PINKY FINGER TIP. A SECOND SCREEN WAS APPLIED JUST BELOW MY XIPHOID AREA BECAUSE THE MUSCLE TISSUE WAS WORN AND THREADED. ON (B)(6) 2012 - AFTER THE FIRST OPERATION, I BEGAN TO FEEL PAIN AND PRESSURE AGAINST MY INTESTINAL TRACK AND INFLAMMATION INSIDE THE RIGHT ABDOMINAL SIDE AREA. I FELT THE SLOWING OF BOWEL MOVEMENTS AND WAS NAUSEATED AT TIMES, ESPECIALLY WHEN I SAT. I STARTED TO HAVE THE ""POISONED"" FEELING IN MY BODY AS MY INTESTINES WERE BEING BLOCKED. I FELT A MASS OF SCAR TISSUE INSIDE ON THE RIGHT SIDE WHEN I BENT OVER OR THE WEIGHT OF IT WHEN I LAID DOWN. ON (B)(6) 2012 - THE SURGEON THEN PERFORMED AN OPERATION A SECOND TIME. HE CUT AND REMOVED THE SCAR TISSUE, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS THE SIZE OF A SOFTBALL (PHOTO AVAILABLE), LOCATED AT THE MESH SCREEN AREA. HE ALSO REMOVED THE ADHESIONS THAT HE FOUND ON BOTH NEW MESH SCREEN AREAS. ON (B)(6) 2012 TO (B)(6) 2013 - AFTER THE SECOND OPERATION THAT REMOVED THE EXCESS SCAR TISSUE, THERE WAS EVEN MORE PAIN. IT FELT LIKE SANDPAPER WAS GRATING INSIDE MY ABDOMEN WHEN I BENT MY BODY TO SIT OR MOVE. AT NIGHT WHEN I WOULD LAY DOWN TO SLEEP, IF I LAID ON MY LEFT SIDE OR TWISTED MY ABDOMEN, I FELT POKING INSIDE. I FELT THE BEST WHEN I STOOD UP AND KEPT PERFECTLY STILL, BUT IT WAS HARD TO PUT WEIGHT ON MY RIGHT LEG. AT TIMES, IT BECAME SO PAINFUL THAT RATHER THAN BENDING MY BODY TO SIT ON A CHAIR IN FRONT OF A DESK AT WORK, I STOOD WITH MY KNEES ON THE FLOOR. THE AREA WHERE THE SCREEN WAS LOCATED IN MY ABDOMEN WAS INFLAMED ON AND OFF DEPENDING UPON IF I HAD EVACUATED A BOWEL MOVEMENT (PRESSURE, TOXINS RELEASED, AND INFLAMMATION REDUCED) OR NOT. I ATE SMALL PORTIONS, SOFT, EASY TO DIGEST, NON-INFLAMMATORY FOOD TO EASE THE PAIN. I WENT BACK TO THE SURGEON AND ASKED HIM TO REMOVE THE MESH SCREEN AS I FELT IT WASN'T WORKING RIGHT IN MY ABDOMEN AREA AND MY BODY WAS REJECTING IT. HE AGREED TO DO A EXPLORATORY SURGERY TO SEE IF HE COULD REMOVE IT. ON (B)(6) 20113 - DURING THE THIRD OPERATION, THE SURGEON FOUND THAT THERE WAS MORE SCAR TISSUE, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS BEFORE, COMING OFF OF THE END OF THE MESH SCREEN AREA (PHOTO AVAILABLE). THE SURGEON HAD DECIDED NOT REMOVE THE MESH AS MOST OF THE SKIN HAD GROWN THROUGH IT, SO THE EXCESS SCAR TISSUE WAS CUT AND THEN CAUTERIZED. IT WAS ALSO DISCOVERED THAT MY INTESTINES WERE FULL OF SCAR TISSUE ON THE SURFACE (PHOTO AVAILABLE), WHICH WAS NOT THERE IN THE PREVIOUS TWO SURGERIES. I TOLD THE SURGEON THAT I KEPT FEELING A GRATING PAIN INSIDE AND I MENTIONED PERHAPS IT WAS FROM THE SCREEN OR THE TACKS. THE SURGEON SAID HE LIFTED MY INTESTINES AND THERE WAS SCAR TISSUE ON THE SIDE TOO. I THEN MENTIONED THAT I KEPT FEELING POKING WHEN I LAY ON MY SIDE. HE TOOK A BIOPSY FOR TESTING, WHICH SHOWED THAT THERE WASN'T CANCER OR ANY OTHER DISEASE. ON (B)(6) 2013 TO CURRENT - MY PAIN STILL CONTINUES AS A ""SIDE EFFECT"". I GO TO A LICENSED ACUPUNCTURIST FROM 1 TO 2 TIMES PER WEEK DEPENDING UPON MY PAIN LEVEL. I SEE AN OSTEOPATH DOCTOR MONTHLY FOR PAIN RELIEF, WHICH IS PROVIDED BY EXTERNAL MANIPULATION ON MY BODY. BETWEEN THESE TWO PRACTITIONERS, THEY HAVE KEPT MY BOWELS MOVING AND PAIN TO A MINIMUM. THE OSTEOPATH HAS ALSO BEEN ABLE TO MASSAGE THE ADHESIONS TO BREAK THEM LOOSE DELAYING SURGERY. WITHOUT THESE TWO HEALTH PROVIDERS, I WOULD HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED AND HAD TO HAVE HAD EMERGENCY INTESTINAL SURGERY. I BELIEVE NO SURGEON (MINE INCLUDED) IS WILLING TO REMOVE THE MESH BECAUSE OF LIABILITY. NOW AT (B)(6) FOR REMOVAL OPTION OPINIONS. MY INTESTINAL ENVIRONMENT IS OFF BALANCE FROM 2 YEARS OF BOWEL OBSTRUCTION, FOR WHICH I AM SEEKING HELP TO TRY AND REBUILD. MESH SCREENS IN A PERSON'S ABDOMEN, THE MOST SENSITIVE SKIN IN THE HUMAN BODY AND LOCATED NEXT TO IMPORTANT VITAL ORGANS, SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. THIS IS A MID-EVIL MEDICAL TORTURE TECHNIQUE. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO REGULATE THE USE OF MESH SCREENS IN HUMAN BODIES. I HAVE A AUTO SUTURE SURGIPRO MESH FOR AN INGUINAL HERNIA SEWN IN (2006) AND I HAVE NEVER HAD PROBLEM. IN 2011, THE SURGICAL INCISION FROM THE INGUINAL HERNIA SURGERY WAS RUPTURED DURING A ROUTINE COLONOSCOPY. IF I'D KNOWN NOW THE COMPLICATIONS THAT I HAVE FROM UTILIZING A MESH SCREEN TO REPAIR IT, I WOULD HAVE OPTED FOR STITCHING IT BACK TOGETHER LIKE IT HAS BEEN FOR 5 YEARS. I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME OPERATION BACK IN THE 1970'S WHO HAD STITCHING AND ARE JUST FINE. THEY HAVE A LARGER SURGERY SCAR AND NOT A HOLE, BUT WHO CARES WHEN IT IS LESS RISKY FOR YOUR HEALTH...UNLESS I GET THIS REMOVED, MY LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AND THE RISK OF CONTINUING BOWL OBSTRUCTION PLACES ME AT A HIGHER RISK FOR INTESTINAL CANCER. I'M ONE OF MANY WITH THIS PROBLEM, IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET. STOP BLAMING IT ON THE SURGEONS, STOP BLAMING IT ON THE MFR'S (UNLESS TRULY A DEFECTIVE DEVICE) AND PROTECT PEOPLE BY STARTING TO REGULATE HOW MESH DEVICES ARE USED.",,,,1.0,2014/06/09,VENTRALEX ST HERNIA PATCH MESH SCREEN,MESH,BARD-DAVOL,,,,,,,,,0,2015/06/30,595008,,HUXF0034,*+H303595000805*,,,FTL,,,,,

ONCE UPON A TIME, I WAS A HEALTHY, ACTIVE PERSON, HAPPILY MARRIED TO MY HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART, RAISING A WONDERFUL SON, AND WORKING AS AN ADMIN FOR A CANCER TREATMENT FACILITY. ALL THAT COMPLETELY CHANGED ON (B)(6) 1999, WHEN MESH MATERIAL WAS FIRST IMPLANTED TO REPAIR AN ABDOMINAL HERNIA. IN ORDER TO PRESENT THE ENTIRE COMPLEXITY OF MY UNIQUE MESH-RELATED EXPERIENCE, I HAVE CHOSEN A CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT: THE PAIN, EXHAUSTION, LOW-GRADE FEVER, OVERALL ACHINESS AND SEROMA DEVELOPMENT STARTED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. ETHICON PROLENE MESH BY JOHNSON & JOHNSON, CAUSED AN AUTOIMMUNE REACTION IN MY BODY. I NEVER RECOVERED FROM THE SURGERY, AND I LOST MY JOB DUE TO THE FACT THAT I WAS UNABLE TO RETURN TO WORK. IT WAS TRULY DEVASTATING. I KEPT RETURNING TO THE DOCTORS, BEGGING FOR THEM TO HELP ME. I WANTED THE MESH REMOVED, BUT WAS TOLD TO ""WAIT AND SEE"". I WAS SENT TO SPECIALISTS, HAD MANY TESTS, AND WAS TOLD SEVERAL TIMES, ""OFF THE RECORD, "" THAT MY BODY WAS REACTING TO THE MESH. SINCE THE IMPLANTATION OF MESH, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ONE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AFTER ANOTHER. AT THAT TIME, I WAS (B)(6) AND MY WORLD WAS FALLING APART. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT HEALTHY, HAPPY WOMAN, THE WIFE AND MOTHER? I WAS MEDICALLY DISABLED AND UNABLE TO WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME. I NEEDED ASSISTANCE WITH EVERYTHING. IT TOOK NEARLY 4 YEARS FOR ME TO GET (B)(6), SO WE SUFFERED FINANCIALLY AS WELL. THERE WAS NO ""RECOVERY"" OR ""GETTING BETTER"". I WAS NOW PERMANENTLY DISABLED AND CHRONICALLY ILL. IN (B)(6) 2009, BLOODWORK REVEALED A POSITIVE ANA AS MY BODY CONTINUED TO REACT TO THE MESH MATERIAL. THIS COMPLEX AUTOIMMUNE PROCESS CONTINUED TO WORSEN AND IN (B)(6) 2009, I HAD TO STOP RECEIVING BIOLOGIC. BY (B)(6) 2009, THE MESH HAD DEGRADED TO SUCH A POINT AND THE FOREIGN BODY REACTION BECAME LIFE-THREATENING, SO A SECOND SURGERY WAS REQUIRED. ON (B)(6) 2010, THE HARDENED, SHRIVELED MASS OF MESH AND TISSUE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH ALLODERM BIOLOGIC MESH AND SOME OTHER PROLENE MESH BY BARD. THE SURGEON WOULD NOT USE ETHICON MESH AGAIN, AND HOPED THAT THESE OTHER PRODUCTS WOULD BE BETTER TOLERATED BY MY BODY, BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.

ONCE UPON A TIME, I WAS A HEALTHY, ACTIVE PERSON, HAPPILY MARRIED TO MY HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART, RAISING A WONDERFUL SON, AND WORKING AS AN ADMIN FOR A CANCER TREATMENT FACILITY. ALL THAT COMPLETELY CHANGED ON (B)(6) 1999, WHEN MESH MATERIAL WAS FIRST IMPLANTED TO REPAIR AN ABDOMINAL HERNIA. IN ORDER TO PRESENT THE ENTIRE COMPLEXITY OF MY UNIQUE MESH-RELATED EXPERIENCE, I HAVE CHOSEN A CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT: THE PAIN, EXHAUSTION, LOW-GRADE FEVER, OVERALL ACHINESS AND SEROMA DEVELOPMENT STARTED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. ETHICON PROLENE MESH BY JOHNSON & JOHNSON, CAUSED AN AUTOIMMUNE REACTION IN MY BODY. I NEVER RECOVERED FROM THE SURGERY, AND I LOST MY JOB DUE TO THE FACT THAT I WAS UNABLE TO RETURN TO WORK. IT WAS TRULY DEVASTATING. I KEPT RETURNING TO THE DOCTORS, BEGGING FOR THEM TO HELP ME. I WANTED THE MESH REMOVED, BUT WAS TOLD TO ""WAIT AND SEE"". I WAS SENT TO SPECIALISTS, HAD MANY TESTS, AND WAS TOLD SEVERAL TIMES, ""OFF THE RECORD, "" THAT MY BODY WAS REACTING TO THE MESH. SINCE THE IMPLANTATION OF MESH, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ONE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AFTER ANOTHER. AT THAT TIME, I WAS (B)(6) AND MY WORLD WAS FALLING APART. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT HEALTHY, HAPPY WOMAN, THE WIFE AND MOTHER? I WAS MEDICALLY DISABLED AND UNABLE TO WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME. I NEEDED ASSISTANCE WITH EVERYTHING. IT TOOK NEARLY 4 YEARS FOR ME TO GET (B)(6), SO WE SUFFERED FINANCIALLY AS WELL. THERE WAS NO ""RECOVERY"" OR ""GETTING BETTER"". I WAS NOW PERMANENTLY DISABLED AND CHRONICALLY ILL. IN (B)(6) 2009, BLOODWORK REVEALED A POSITIVE ANA AS MY BODY CONTINUED TO REACT TO THE MESH MATERIAL. THIS COMPLEX AUTOIMMUNE PROCESS CONTINUED TO WORSEN AND IN (B)(6) 2009, I HAD TO STOP RECEIVING BIOLOGIC. BY (B)(6) 2009, THE MESH HAD DEGRADED TO SUCH A POINT AND THE FOREIGN BODY REACTION BECAME LIFE-THREATENING, SO A SECOND SURGERY WAS REQUIRED. ON (B)(6) 2010, THE HARDENED, SHRIVELED MASS OF MESH AND TISSUE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH ALLODERM BIOLOGIC MESH AND SOME OTHER PROLENE MESH BY BARD. THE SURGEON WOULD NOT USE ETHICON MESH AGAIN, AND HOPED THAT THESE OTHER PRODUCTS WOULD BE BETTER TOLERATED BY MY BODY, BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. I CONTINUED TO HAVE ABDOMINAL PAIN, SEROMAS, LOW GRADE FEVERS, ALONG WITH ALL THE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES THAT CAME WITH THE USE OF MESH. NOW, WE GET TO THE PROLAPSED BLADDER.

I'VE HAD EIGHT SURGERIES TO ADDRESS THE DEVICES ERODING, SCARRING, AND MAIMING ME. THE MOST RECENT SURGERY, THE SURGEON WAS ABLE TO REMOVE 98.9% OF THE INITIAL MESH. HOWEVER, THE MESH WAS TAKEN OUT IN 15 PIECES, IT WAS ALL OVER MY PELVIC FLOOR, INSERTED INTO MUSCLE, AND MAJOR NERVES, BOTH PUDENDAL, AND OBTURATOR NERVES ARE AFFECTED, PERHAPS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. AS THE SURGEON STATED, ""THIS WAS A VERY COMPLICATED AND VERY DIFFICULT SURGERY, REQUIRING EXTRA TIME AND EFFORT. THERE WAS SEVERE SCARRING IN EVERY SPACE AND SEGMENT OF THE PELVIC FLOOR. ANTERIORLY, POSTERIORLY, LATERALLY, AS WELL AS UNDER THE URETHRA. ""WATCH THIS PAGE: I HAD THE EXPLANT SURGERY IN (B)(6) 2014, I STILL HAVE YET TO FULLY HEAL. THE NERVE DAMAGE MAY VERY WELL BE PERMANENT. I HAVE NOT HAD INTERCOURSE IN SEVEN YEARS, AND THIS WAS DUE TO THE VAGINAL CANAL BECOMING SHORTENED BECAUSE THE DEVICE CRUMBLED, ""BUNCHED UP, AND CORDED."" PLUS, THERE WERE ALSO PARTS OF THE DEVICE COMING APART INSIDE ME. I HAD A FOREIGN BODY REACTION, NUMEROUS INFECTION, AND UNTOLD HOURS, DAYS, YEARS, MISSING OUT ON DAILY LIVING. MY RELATIONSHIPS IN EVERY FACET OF MY LIFE HAVE BEEN EFFECTED. MY CHILDREN HAVE GROWN UP WITHOUT A MOM. I LOVE MY CHILDREN, AND I WAS ONCE A VERY ACTIVE MOTHER, ON THE PTA, AND CLASS PARENT. ONCE THERE WAS A TIME IN MY LIFE THAT WEEKENDS MEANT SOCCER, BASEBALL, SWIM MEETS. ONCE THERE WAS A TIME THAT I COULD GO WATCH MY SON RECEIVE ACADEMIC AWARDS, IT WAS NOT EASY SITTING, BUT NOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I HAVEN'T SEEN A CHRISTMAS PAGEANT IN TWO YEARS, I HAVEN'T BEEN TO MY SON'S SCHOOL OR ITS OPEN HOUSES, IN TWO YEARS. THE MESH TOOK IT ALL AWAY FROM ME. I CANNOT GET OUT OF BED. I'VE JUST HAD ALL THE MESH EXPLANTED, AND THE SURGEON DESCRIBED IT AS BEING ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT CASES HE'S EVER SEEN. I HAVE A HOPE THAT ONE DAY, AND VERY SOON, THAT THIS MESH IS COMPLETELY BANNED AND THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE OF A WARNING ASSOCIATED WITH ITS USE. THE COMPANIES HAVE ACCEPTED NO RESPONSIBILITY IN JUST HOW AWFUL THIS PRODUCT IS. BEING AN OIL BASED PRODUCT, AKIN TO THE SAME MATERIAL AS A ""HOOLA-HOOP"", IS HOW IT WAS DESCRIBED TO ME, BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. I NEVER RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM THE IMPLANT SURGEON: WHY? HOW COULD THIS MATERIAL BE SO COMMONLY USED, WITHOUT THE COMPANY EVER TESTING IT, HOW DID AN OLD 510C RULE LET THIS PRODUCT BE USED? THE FDA REALLY NEEDS TO HAVE THE CLASS MOVED TO CLASS 3 DEVICES, OR BANNED COMPLETELY, SO, THAT NO ONE EVER HAS TO FEEL WHAT I FEEL EVERY DAY OF MY DISMAL LIFE.

I EXPECTED HIM TO SAY OR ASK ME WHERE I WANTED TO GO TO GET THIS THING REMOVED BUT THAT DID NOT HAPPEN, HE DID SEND ME FOR A CT SCAN BUT THEY SAID THEY WERE ONLY TOLD TO DO THE ""FLY"" LOWER ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC EXAM.

WHY ARE WE NOT BEING CONTACTED AND TOLD WHERE WE CAN GO FOR HELP IF WE FEEL WE HAVE REJECTED THESE DEVICES?

TALKED TO THE DOCTOR ON CALL AND BY THE TIME HE CALLED BACK I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. ON (B)(6) 2014 ADMITTED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. ABDOMINAL CT SCAN FOUND A LOCALIZED OBSTRUCTION OF THE SMALL BOWEL. A NASOGASTRIC TUBE WAS INSERTED IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO REMOVE THE OBSTRUCTED FLUIDS. ON (B)(6) 2014: A SECOND ABDOMINAL CT CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS NO PROGRESS IN THE SBO AND A SECOND EMERGENCY SURGERY WAS PERFORMED TO FIND THAT THE MESH HAD ADHERED TO MY SMALL BOWEL. THE MESH WAS REMOVED. ON (B)(6) 2014: SPENT THE NEXT FIVE DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL RECOVERING FROM THE PROCEDURE. TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NEITHER DR.

THESE ARE JUST A FEW ISSUES I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH SINCE THE IMPLANT: PAIN, DISCOMFORT TO PUT IT MILDLY, MORE SEVERE INCONTINENCE, PAINFUL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE TO WHERE EVEN MY LEGS WOULD CRAMP UP AND FEET WOULD CURL UNDER. AFTER SEVERAL TIMES I STOP HAVING SEX BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE PAIN: LOWER BACK PAIN, ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC PAIN, GASTROINTESTINAL PAIN, BLADDER AND BOWEL INCONTINENCE, LOST OVER FIFTY POUNDS BECAUSE OF NAUSEA FROM ALL THE PAIN. HAVING TO TAKE PAIN PILLS ON A DAILY BASIS IN ORDER TO JUST TAKE THE EDGE OFF THE PAIN. IT IS ALMOST LIKE BEING IN LABOR FOR OVER FIVE YEARS AND MY BODY IS SO WORN DOWN TO WHERE I DON'T FEEL I CAN LAST MUCH LONGER. SHORTLY AFTER THE IMPLANT I HAD TO WALK WITH A STAFF FOR MY BALANCE AND SO I WOULD FOCUS ON KEEPING MY POSTURE AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE. I KNEW I NEEDED TO GET BACK IN A HEATED POOL AND WALK AND RUN ON THE TREADMILL IN ORDER TO HELP THIS BODY. HOWEVER, EVEN JOGGING IN WATER WOULD CAUSE MY LEGS AND FEET TO CRAMP UP TO WHERE I KNEW I COULD NO LONGER JOG IN WATER. I RECENTLY ASKED TO START WATER THERAPY ONCE AGAIN BUT IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS I HAVE ONLY BEEN PHYSICALLY ABLE TO GO ONCE. THEY TOLD ME I HAVE TO BE THERE AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK AND I JUST CAN'T MANAGE SO I WILL HAVE TO STEP AWAY AT LEAST UNTIL AFTER MY SURGERY. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG PERSON AND PUSHED THROUGH MANY CHALLENGES IN MY LIFE BUT THIS ONE HAS ME ALMOST BEAT. I AM IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING MY MEDICAL INFO TO A DOCTOR THAT WILL DO A TOTAL MESH REMOVAL SO THIS BODY WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO HEAL. SINCE I HAVE HAD THIS PROCEDURE MY WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT STAYS ELEVATED. I HAVE BEEN IN THE HOSP SEVERAL TIMES WITH VERY LITTLE HELP. I RECENTLY WAS SENT TO A HEMATOLOGIST BECAUSE OF MY WBC AND HE STATED THAT CONTINUES PHYSICAL STRESS FROM THE SLING COULD CAUSE MY WHITE BLOOD COUNT TO STAY ELEVATED. THEREFORE, IN ORDER FOR MY BODY TO BE ABLE TO HEAL THE SLING NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. HOPEFULLY, WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO, I WILL BE SEEING A SPECIALIST THAT IS SEVERAL STATES AWAY. THIS TRIP IS OVERWHELMING BECAUSE JUST THINKING OF ME LEAVING MY HOME TO GO EVEN A FEW MILES IS A CHALLENGE, NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE PAIN BUT ALSO IN CASE I CAN'T LOCATE A BATHROOM IN TIME. PLEASE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WOMEN ARE JUST MAKING UP. THIS IS A LIVING HELL THAT NO HUMAN BEING SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH. PEOPLE USED TO LOOK AT ME AS SOMEONE THAT WAS SO STRONG BECAUSE OF ALL THE CHALLENGES I HAVE OVERCOME. I WAS EVEN ONE THAT SELECTED TO GIVE BIRTH OF MY DAUGHTER AT HOME, SO I KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH PAIN AND AT LEAST AFTER NINE MONTHS AND SEVERAL HOURS OF LABOR I HAD A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER. THIS PAIN THAT HAS FELT A LOT LIKE LABOR HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER FIVE YEARS. I HAVE TOLD PEOPLE THAT I AM NOT SUICIDAL, BUT I DON'T WANT TO REMAIN IN THIS BODY ANY LONGER IF NOTHING CAN BE DONE. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY A FEW DOCTORS HERE IN (B)(6) THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE, SO I ALMOST GAVE UP HOPE SO NOW I AGREE THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE HERE IN (B)(6).

THEY WROTE ME OUT PRESCRIPTIONS FOR PAIN AND SENT ME HOME. I ENDED UP DOUBLING OVER WITH UNBEARABLE PAIN AND HAD TO MAKE A THIRD VISIT. AT THIS TIME, I WAS SEEN BY A DOCTOR WHO ACTUALLY TOOK THE TIME TO RUN TEST AND CRAFTS TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. I WAS THEN TOLD THAT I HAD TO BE ADMITTED. I WAS VERY SURPRISED BY THAT. THE DOCTOR THAT SEEN ME ASKED WHY I WAS SURPRISED. MY RESPONSE WAS THAT THIS WAS MY THIRD VISIT, AND I WASN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY DURING MY OTHER VISITS. HE THEN WENT ON TO TELL ME THAT IF I WASN'T ADMITTED THAT I WOULD BE DEAD IN A WEEK. I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS HEARING. I FEEL THEY WERE VERY NEGLECTFUL WITH ME. I ENDED UP HAVING TO HAVE A COMPLETE HYSTERECTOMY DUE TO INFECTION GOING ALL THROUGH ME. THE DOCTOR WHO DID MY HYSTERECTOMY EVEN SAID THAT IT SHOULD HAVE NOT COME TO THAT, IF THEY HAD ONLY CHECKED ME OUT THOROUGHLY DURING MY OTHER VISITS. IT WAS ALL VERY PAINFUL FOR ME. PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. I NEVER HAD ANY CHILDREN AND UNFORTUNATELY I NEVER WILL NOW. ANYWAY I HAVE RECENTLY TALKED TO A LAWYER WHO HAS ADVISED ME TO CONTACT YOU WITH THIS MATTER. I DID NOT KNOW BACK IN 2009 WHO TO CONTACT ABOUT IT, OR THAT ANYTHING COULD EVEN BE DONE. I ORIGINALLY CONTACTED THE LAWYER ABOUT THIS TRANSVAGINAL MESH. I HAVE MY MEDICAL RECORDS, BUT THE LAWYER SAID THAT BECAUSE IT WAS DONE THROUGH MY ABDOMEN THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT, SO I WAS ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT FDA. A FORM OF MESH WAS PUT INSIDE ME. I HAVE BEEN HAVING MEDICAL PROBLEMS WITH MY ABDOMEN FOR SOME TIME NOW AND OTHER PROBLEMS AS WELL. I HAVE TO SEE MY GYNECOLOGIST EVERY FOUR MONTHS TO BE CHECKED FOR CANCER BECAUSE MY PAP SMEARS KEEP COMING BACK ABNORMAL. THEY SAY I AM HIGH RISK FOR GETTING CANCER. WHICH I HAVE NEVER HAD. I HAVE TERRIBLE PAINS AND TROUBLE URINATING AT TIMES. I CAN'T EVEN HAVE INTERCOURSE AND I'M ONLY (B)(6) YEARS OLD. REASON BEING IT IS TOO PAINFUL. I HEAR THAT THIS IS ALL SYMPTOMS OF WOMEN SUFFERING WITH THIS MESH. SO WOULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME AND TAKE ALL OF THIS INTO CONSIDERATION. I'M TOO YOUNG TO BE FEELING THE WAY THAT I FEEL.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: AFTER RISKS AND BENEFITS WERE EXPLAINED, INFORMED CONSENT WAS OBTAINED. THE PATIENT WAS BROUGHT TO THE SURGICAL SUITE AND PLACED IN SUPINE POSITION. AFTER INDUCTION OF GENERAL ANESTHETIC, THE ABDOMEN WAS PREPPED WITH CHLORAPREP AND DRAPED IN A STERILE FASHION. AN INCISION WAS MADE IN THE LEFT LATERAL ABDOMEN ALONG THE ANTERIOR AXILLARY LINE, ALLOWED PLACEMENT OF AN 11 MM TROCAR JUST UNDERNEATH THE EXTERNAL OBLIQUE APONEUROSIS. THIS ALLOWED PLACEMENT OF A BALLOON DISSECTOR WITHIN THIS SPACE, WHICH WAS ENLARGED. A BALLOON-TIP CATHETER WAS THEN PLACED, AND AREA WAS INSUFFLATED. A 5 MM TROCAR WAS PLACED IN THE LEFT LOWER QUADRANT, AND COMPONENT SEPARATION WAS PERFORMED ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE EXTERNAL OBLIQUE CEPHALAD TO CAUDAD. TROCARS WERE THEN REMOVED. SCAR WAS EXCISED WITH THE CAUTERY AND PASSED OFF THE FIELD AS SPECIMEN. CONTINUED DISSECTION. ABDOMEN WAS ENTERED, AND ADHESIONS WERE FREED FROM THE FASCIAL EDGE. AN OLD PIECE OF PROCEED MESH WAS NOTICED ALONG THE RIGHT EDGE OF THE HERNIA NECK WHICH WAS VERY LARGE. ALL ADHESIONS WERE LYSED, AND OLD MESH WAS CUT AWAY FROM THE RIGHT RECTUS ABDOMINIS FROM ALONG THE EDGE AND PASSED OFF THE FIELD AS SPECIMEN. THE RIGHT RECTUS WAS FREED FROM THE SUBCUTANEOUS FASCIA, AND IT WAS FREED ALONG THE EXTERNAL OBLIQUE LATERALLY TO LATERAL TO THE RECTUS ABDOMINIS. THE EXTERNAL OBLIQUE WAS INCISED IN A LONGITUDINAL FASHION RELEASING THIS COMPONENT FOR BILATERAL MYOCUTANEOUS ADVANCEMENT FLAPS. A 24 X 20 PIECE OF STRATTICE MESH WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE FIELD. IT WAS TURNED IN A DIAMOND FASHION. IT WAS SECURED CEPHALAD AND INFERIOR JUST ABOVE THE PUBIS AND LATERAL. THE SUTURES WERE BROUGHT UP LATERAL TO THE RECTUS WITH A SUTURE PASSER, AND 3-0 PDS SUTURES WERE PLACED BETWEEN THESE FOUR SUTURES SECURING THE EDGE OF THE MESH TO THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL. THE MIDLINE FASCIA WAS THEN APPROXIMATED WITH DOUBLE-STRANDED 0 PDS. TWO LARGE 19-FRENCH ROUND BLAKE DRAINS WERE PLACED IN THE LOWER ABDOMEN IN THE LATERAL ABDOMEN SECURED WITH A 2-0 NYLON. HEMOSTASIS WAS WELL ACHIEVED. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A MODEST AMOUNT OF BLEEDING FROM ALL THE DISSECTION. THE SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUES WERE APPROXIMATED WITH RUNNING 2-0 VICRYL, AND THE SKIN WAS APPROXIMATED WITH A STAPLER. DRESSINGS WERE APPLIED .ANESTHESIA WAS DISCONTINUED.

I HAD COMPLICATION WITH THIS SURGERY INVOLVING A SEROMA AND A WOUND INFECTION. THE SURGEON HAD STATED THAT THE VICRYL MESH WOULD DISSOLVE. NEEDLESS TO SAY I SPENT A YEAR ON A WOUND VAC AND A YEAR LATER SURGERY DISCOVERED ACUTE AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION WITH HEMORRHAGE AND NECROSIS. I CONTINUED HAVING REOCCURRING PAIN IN THE ABDOMEN. IN (B)(6) 2012 I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL WITH SEPSIS. I COLLAPSED ON THE GURNEY WITH 104 DEGREE FEVER AND EXTREMELY LOW BLOOD PRESSURE. THEY HAD INFUSED ME WITH SO MANY FLUIDS TO GET MY BLOOD PRESSURE UP THAT MY LEGS AND FEET HAD BALLOONED AND I WOULD NOT WEAR MY SHOES. BASICALLY, I WAS LUCKY TO BE ALIVE. IN (B)(6) 2014 I WAS HOSPITALIZED WITH SEPSIS, KIDNEY FAILURE, AND ACUTE BRONCHITIS. I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL (ICU) FOR A WEEK AND WHEN I WAS DISCHARGED I WAS VERY WEAK AND I HAD DEVELOPED A BLOOD BLISTER ON MY ABDOMEN. MY DOCTOR WAS NOT SURE WHAT THE BLOOD BLISTER CAME FROM AND I WAS DISCHARGED ON A FRIDAY EVEN THOUGH MY ABDOMEN WAS SORE. I WAS WEAK AND I HAD FALLEN AND THE BLOOD BLISTER HAD BROKEN (SATURDAY). I WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BY AMBULANCE AND UNDERWENT EMERGENCY SURGERY TWICE TO CLEAN THE DEAD TISSUE FROM MY WOUND. THE SURGEON TOLD MY FAMILY IT WAS VERY SERIOUS AND IT WAS POSSIBLE I WOULD NOT MAKE IT. MY ABDOMEN WAS FILLED WITH DEAD TISSUE. I HAD A SERIOUS BACTERIAL INFECTION KNOWN AS NECROTIZING FASCIITIS. NECROTIZING FASCIITIS IS AN INFECTION THAT STARTS IN THE TISSUES JUST BELOW THE SKIN AND SPREADS ALONG THE FLAT LAYERS OF TISSUE (KNOWN AS FASCIA) THAT SEPARATE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF SOFT TISSUE, SUCH AS MUSCLE AND FAT. MY INFECTION WAS LOCATED IN MY ABDOMINAL WALL AND IS FATAL IN 30 - 40 PERCENT OF CASES. NECROTIZING FASCIITIS IS A TERM THAT DESCRIBES A DISEASE CONDITION OF RAPIDLY SPREADING INFECTION, USUALLY LOCATED IN FASCIAL PLANES OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE THAT RESULTS IN TISSUE NECROSIS (DEAD AND DAMAGED TISSUE). PERITONITIS IS AN INFLAMMATION OF THE PERITONEUM, THE TISSUE THAT LINES THE INNER WALL OF THE ABDOMEN AND COVERS AND SUPPORTS MOST OF YOUR ABDOMINAL ORGANS. PERITONITIS IS USUALLY CAUSED BY INFECTION FROM BACTERIA OR FUNGI. NECROTIZING FASCIITIS IS A SERIOUS CONDITION THAT IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH SEPSIS AND WIDESPREAD ORGAN FAILURE. NECROTIZING FASCIITIS REFERS TO A RAPIDLY SPREADING INFECTION, USUALLY LOCATED IN FASCIAL PLANES OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE THAT RESULTS IN TISSUE DEATH (NECROSIS). PERITONITIS CAN RAPIDLY SPREAD INTO THE BLOOD (SEPSIS) AND TO OTHER ORGANS, RESULTING IN MULTIPLE ORGAN FAILURE AND DEATH. THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF PERITONITIS ARE POOR APPETITE AND NAUSEA, AND A DULL ABDOMINAL ACHE THAT QUICKLY TURNS INTO PERSISTENT, SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN, WHICH IS WORSENED BY ANY MOVEMENT. AN INTERNAL FISTULAE (WHEN AN ABNORMAL CONNECTION DEVELOPS BETWEEN ORGANS THAT DO NOT USUALLY CONNECT). THE SURGEON DISCOVERED THAT I HAD A BOWEL PERFORATION CAUSED BY THE VICRYL MESH. THE CONTENTS OF THE BOWEL FLOWED INTO MY ABDOMINAL CAVITY, LEADING TO A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS, INCLUDING PERITONITIS. I HAVE AN OPEN WOUND ON MY ABDOMEN 22 CM WIDE BY 18 CM. THE SURGEON STATED THAT THIS WAS THE LARGEST WOUND HE EVER DEALT WITH. I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR APPROXIMATELY A MONTH AND THEN SENT TO A NURSING HOME FOR A MONTH. I HAD A WOUND VAC ON MY ABDOMEN. I HAD OTHER NUMEROUS ADMISSIONS TO THE HOSPITAL DURING THIS TIME. I ALSO WAS ON TPN FOR OVER SIX MONTHS. I HAD SURGERY (B)(6) 2014 AND REMOVED THE MESH AND HAD A BOWEL RESECTION.

I WAS COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF THIS. ON (B)(6) 2006, I HAD A VENTRAL HERNIA REPAIR. AT THAT TIME I HAD A FASCIAL REAPPROXIMATION WITH LATERAL RELAXING INCISION AND A 12 X 12 INCH PIECE OF VICRYL MESH PLACED AS AN OVERLAY. I HAD COMPLICATION WITH THIS SURGERY INVOLVING A SEROMA AND A WOUND INFECTION. THE SURGEON HAD STATED THAT THE VICRYL MESH WOULD DISSOLVE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I SPENT A YEAR ON A WOUND VAC AND A YEAR LATER SURGERY DISCOVERED ACUTE AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION WITH HEMORRHAGE AND NECROSIS. IN (B)(6) 2012, I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL WITH SEPSIS. I COLLAPSED ON THE GURNEY WITH 104 DEGREE FEVER AND EXTREMELY LOW BLOOD PRESSURE. THEY HAD INFUSED ME WITH SO MANY FLUIDS TO GET MY BLOOD PRESSURE UP THAT MY LEGS AND FEET HAD BALLOONED SO THAT I COULD NOT WEAR MY SHOES. I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL ICU UNIT FOR A WEEK AND I WAS DISCHARGED ON A FRIDAY AND MY SON WAS GETTING MARRIED SATURDAY. I HAD TO WEAR FLIP FLOPS AND I WAS EXTREMELY EMBARRASSED. BASICALLY, I WAS LUCK TO BE ALIVE. IN (B)(6) 2014 I WAS HOSPITALIZED WITH SEPSIS, KIDNEY FAILURE, AND ACUTE BRONCHITIS. I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL (ICU) FOR A WEEK AND WHEN I WAS DISCHARGED I WAS VERY WEAK AND I HAD DEVELOPED A BLOOD BLISTER ON MY ABDOMEN. MY DOCTOR WAS NOT SURE WHAT THE BLOOD BLISTER CAME FROM AND I WAS DISCHARGED ON A FRIDAY EVEN THOUGH MY ABDOMEN WAS SORE. I WS WEAK AND I HAD FALLEN AND THE BLOOD BLISTER HAD BROKEN (SATURDAY). I WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BY AMBULANCE AND UNDERWENT EMERGENCY SURGERY TWICE TO CLEAN THE DEAD TISSUE FROM MY WOUND. THE SURGEON TOLD MY FAMILY IT WAS VERY SERIOUS AND IT WAS POSSIBLE I WOULD NOT MAKE IT. ABDOMEN WAS FILLED WITH DEAD TISSUE. I HAD A SERIOUS BACTERIAL INFECTION KNOWN AS NECROTIZING FASCIITIS. NECROTIZING FASCIITIS IS AN INFECTION THAT STARTS IN THE TISSUES JUST BELOW THE SKIN AND SPREADS ALONG THE FLAT LAYERS OF TISSUE (KNOWN A FASCIAL) THAT SEPARATE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF SOFT TISSUE, SUCH AS MUSCLE AND FAT. MY INFECTION WAS LOCATED IN MY ABDOMINAL WALL AND IS FATAL IN 30-40% OF CASES. NECROTIZING FASCIITIS IS A TERM THAT DESCRIBES A DISEASE CONDITION OF RAPIDLY SPREADING INFECTION, USUALLY LOCATED IN FASCIAL PLANES OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE THAT RESULTS IN TISSUE NECROSIS (DEAD AND DAMAGED TISSUE). PERITONITIS IS AN INFLAMMATION OF THE PERITONEUM, THE TISSUE THAT LINES THE INNER WALL OF THE ABDOMEN AND COVERS AND SUPPORTS MOST OF YOUR ABDOMINAL ORGANS. PERITONITIS IS USUALLY CAUSED BY INFECTION FROM BACTERIA OR FUNGI. NECROTIZING FASCIITIS IS A SERIOUS CONDITION THAT IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH SEPSIS AND WIDESPREAD ORGAN FAILURE. NECROTIZING FASCIITIS REFERS TO A RAPIDLY SPREADING INFECTION, USUALLY LOCATED IN FASCIAL PLANES OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE THAT RESULTS IN TISSUE DEATH (NECROSIS). PERITONITIS CAN RAPIDLY SPREAD IN THE BLOOD (SEPSIS) AND TO OTHER ORGANS, RESULTING IN MULTIPLE ORGAN FAILURE AND DEATH. THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF PERITONITIS ARE POOR APPETITE AND NAUSEA, AND A DULL ABDOMINAL ACHE THAT QUICKLY TURNS INTO PERSISTENT, SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN, WHICH IS WORSENED BY ANY MOVEMENT. AN INTERNAL FISTULA (WHEN AN ABNORMAL CONNECTION DEVELOPS BETWEEN ORGANS THAT DO NOT USUALLY CONNECT). THE SURGEON DISCOVERED THAT I HAD A BOWEL PERFORATION CAUSED BY THE VICRYL MESH. THE CONTENTS OF THE BOWEL FLOWED INTO MY ABDOMINAL CAVITY, LEADING TO A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS, INCLUDING PERITONITIS. I HAVE AN OPEN WOUND ON MY ABDOMEN 22 CM WIDE BY 18 CM. THE SURGEON STATED THAT THIS WAS THE LARGEST WOUND HE EVER DEALT WITH. I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR APPROX. A MONTH AND THEN SENT TO A NURSING HOME FOR A MONTH. I HAD A WOUND VAC ON MY ABDOMEN. I HAD OTHER NUMEROUS ADMISSIONS TO THE HOSPITAL DURING THIS TIME. I ALSO WAS ON TPN (THIS WAS LIQUID NUTRITION) THAT IS INTRAVENOUSLY GIVEN TO ME THROUGH A PIC LINE. SINCE THE SURGERY, I CONTINUED WITH EPISODES OF VOMITING, HEADACHES, ABDOMINAL PAIN, ABDOMINAL DEFORMITY, HERNIA RECURRENCE, INFECTION, INFLAMMATION, PAIN AND SWELLING AND FREQUENT SICKNESSES, AND NUMEROUS ACHES AND PAINS.

SENT FOR BLOOD TESTS. SENT HOME AFTER NOTHING WAS FOUND TO CAUSE THESE CONDITIONS. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH OF MY OWN, FOUND THAT VICODIN HAD BEEN REFORMULATED AND THAT WAS CAUSING MY HALLUCINATIONS. ON (B)(6) 2014, A PRESCRIPTION OF TYLENOL #3 WAS CALLED IN.

BECAUSE OF THIS ADVICE, I AGREED TO BE IMPLANTED WITH THE ETHICON GYNECARE TVT SECURE SYSTEM SLING. HE DID THE SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2006. ABOUT 2 YRS LATER, I STARTED TO DEVELOP SYMPTOMS OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS. EACH TIME MY DOCTOR DID A URINALYSIS, NOTHING SHOWED UP. ABOUT THE SAME TIME I STARTED TO HAVE THESE SYMPTOMS, INTERCOURSE WITH MY HUSBAND BECAME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE, AND IT GREW INCREASINGLY PAINFUL OVER TIME, TO THE POINT I JUST REFUSED MY HUSBAND. HE ALSO FOUND IT UNCOMFORTABLE. WE FINALLY STOPPED TRYING ALTOGETHER. ON (B)(6) 2012, I SAW DR. (B)(6) ABOUT THE CONTINUING INFECTIONS AND PAINFUL INTERCOURSE (BY THIS TIME MY HUSBAND AND I HAD NOT HAD INTERCOURSE FOR SEVERAL YEARS). UPON EXAMINATION, SHE COULD SEE AND FEEL THAT THE MESH SLING HAD ""MIGRATED THROUGH INTO THE VAGINA"". SHE EXPLAINED THAT THIS WAS WHAT WAS CAUSING THE URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS AND THE PAINFUL ATTEMPTS AT INTERCOURSE. SHE HAD ME FEEL FOR MYSELF AND INDEED I COULD ACTUALLY FEEL THE MESH IN MY VAGINA! SHE SAID, ""HAVEN'T YOU SEE ALL THE ADS FOR ATTORNEYS FOR THESE THINGS ON TV?"" SINCE I RARELY WATCH TV AND NEVER DURING THE DAY, I HAD NO IDEA SUCH PROBLEMS WERE BEING REPORTED. SHE EXPLAINED THAT I NEEDED SURGERY TO TRY AND REPAIR AND CUT AWAY THE MESH THAT HAD MIGRATED INTO THE VAGINA. I AGREED WITH HER ASSESSMENT AND WE SCHEDULED IT FOR (B)(6) 2012. FOLLOWING MY VISIT WITH DR. (B)(6), I DECIDED TO CALL DR. (B)(6) WHO HAD DONE THE ORIGINAL SURGERY AND PLACEMENT OF THE SLING IN 2006 TO GET HIS OPINION.

(B)(6) OFFICE, THERE WERE NO OTHER PATIENTS, AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE ME SIGN IN. A NURSE PRACTITIONER GOT ME READY FOR THE EXAM AND THEN DR. (B)(6) CAME IN AND EXAMINED ME. AFTER THE EXAM HE TOLD ME TO GET DRESSED AND WE COULD DISCUSS NEXT DOOR IN HIS OFFICE. HE SEEMED VERY DEFENSIVE ABOUT THE MESH SLING ISSUE WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO ASK QUESTIONS. HE SUGGESTED I USE ESTROGEN CREAM DAILY (WHICH HE GAVE ME) FOR SEVERAL WEEKS PRE-SURGERY. DR. (B)(6) HAD ALREADY TOLD ME TO DO THAT. HE THEN TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD GLADLY PERFORM THE SURGERY PRO-BONO AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL IF I WANTED HIM TO. HE EMPHASIZED THAT I SHOULD BE CAREFUL WITH ANY SURGEON WHO WAS TOO AGGRESSIVE IN THE SURGERY WHO MIGHT CUT AWAY TOO MUCH OF THE MESH. I GOT THE SENSE THAT HE FELT HE WAS THE ONLY QUALIFIED ONE TO DO SUCH SURGERY. AFTER I LEFT THAT MEETING I DECIDED I WANTED DR. (B)(6) TO DO THE SURGERY FOR SURE EVEN THOUGH COSTS WOULD BE INVOLVED. I SIMPLY FELT THAT DR. (B)(6) WAS TOO DEFENSIVE ABOUT THE ENTIRE SUBJECT. ALSO, I QUESTIONED WHY HE WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THE SURGERY AT NO CHARGE?

AND IF I HAD QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW UP AT HOME OR IF ANY SERIOUS PROBLEMS, GO TO E.R. SO THEY DISCHARGED HER TO HOME WITH NO STEP DOWN FROM CRITICAL CARE. AND WAS VERY WEAK AND WHEN I BROUGHT HER HOME I HAD TO CARRY HER IN THE BATHROOM BECAUSE SHE WAS SO WEAK AND HER FEET AND WHOLE BODY WAS SO SWELLED SHE COULD NOT WALK ON HER OWN. NEVER DID GET TO SEE OR TALK TO DR. (B)(6) BEFORE DISCHARGE FROM (B)(6). THE NEXT DAY WE WENT TO SEE DR. (B)(6), HE THEN ORDERED HER LASIX, LMODIUM AND COMPLETE BED REST ALSO A FLUID RESTRICTION UNTIL HE COULD SPEAK WITH DR. (B)(6) OR DR. (B)(6). WE THEN LEFT AND HEADED HOME, AND SHE STARTED COUGHING UP A HUGE AMOUNT OF BLOOD SO I CALLED DR. (B)(6) BACK, HE SAID TAKE HER DIRECTLY TO HOSPITAL FOR ADMISSION. THEN SHE WAS ADMITTED TO (B)(6) FOR ANOTHER 28 DAYS FOR COUGHING UP BLOOD, FLUID OVERLOAD AND C-DIFF AND INFECTION IN THE LUNGS AND AIRWAY. DR. (B)(6) WAS IN I.C.U. WAITING FOR ME AND HANDED ME A SURGERY REPORT THAT STATED THE SUTURE WAS IN THERE FROM HER ORIGINAL SURGERY IN 2004? IN THE MEANTIME, I KEPT TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF DR. (B)(6) FOR 2-3 MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS HER BEST COURSE OF CARE, HE WOULD NOT RETURN OUR CALLS SO WHILE TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF HIM, WE WENT SEVERAL OTHER SURGEONS FOR A SECOND OPINION AND OF COURSE THEY ALL TOLD US TO GO BACK TO DR. (B)(6). SO I THEN HAD TO GET AN ATTORNEY TO SEND HIM A LETTER. HE THEN CALLED US BACK AND SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR SURGERY SAID SHE WOULD NEED SURGERY. AFTER 2 SURGERIES, HE THEN SAID SHE WOULD NEED 12 OR 13 MORE SURGERIES 3-4 MONTHS APART TO STRAIGHTEN HER AIRWAY AND DILATATION LASER AND LAVAGE TO REMOVE THE REMAINDER OF THE SUTURE MATERIAL IN HER AIRWAY AND LUNG, BUT THEN HE SAID HE WAS LEAVING TO MOVE OUT OF TOWN, SO HE WAS LEAVING ME IN THE CARE OF DR. (B)(6) AND HE WOULD DO THE REMAINDER OF THE SURGERY AFTER 2 OR 3 SURGERIES WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY, HE THEN REFERRED US TO HIS BOSS AT (B)(6) CENTER DR. (B)(6). ALSO DURING ALL OF THESE SURGERIES (B)(6) STARTED COUGHING UP STAPLE'S, RADIATION SEEDS AND MESH MATERIAL AND OFF AND ON BLOOD WE WERE JUST TOLD GO TO E.R., IF SHE COUGHED UP MORE THAN A TEASPOON OF BRIGHT RED BLOOD, WE THEN WENT TO SEE DR. (B)(6), HE ORDERED A 3D SCAN OF THE AREA AND WHEN WE WENT BACK TO SEE HIM HE THEN INFORMED US THAT THE MESH IMPLANT THAT WAS INSTALLED IN THE ORIGINAL SURGERY HAD MOVED DOWN OVER THE AIRWAY AND HAS JUST LAID THERE AND DAMAGED HER AIRWAY. SHE WOULD NOT BE A CANDIDATE FOR A LOBECTOMY OR A LUNG TRANSPLANT. BUT, HE WOULD CONTINUE DR. (B)(6). WE THEN SAID THAT WAS GREAT AS LONG AS HE WOULD DO THE SURGERY BECAUSE AT THIS POINT WE WERE NOT WILLING TO BE TREATED BY ANYONE NOT FAMILIAR OR UNQUALIFIED TO TREAT (B)(6) AND THIS SITUATION SHE WAS IN. HE AGREED AND STATED HE WOULD DO THEM HIMSELF. THEN IT SEEMED HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION FOUND OUT HE WAS TREATING (B)(6). AND ACCORDING TO MY PAPERWORK HE ONLY ACTUALLY DID 1 OR 2 PROCEDURES HIMSELF. SO OVER THE COURSE OF 7 OR 8 PROCEDURES HE ONLY DID 1 OR 2 AND LET NEWLY GRADUATED DRS OR STUDENT DRS DO THE REMAINDER OF ALL THE OTHER PROCEDURES AND LET ON TO US THAT HE WAS DOING THOSE PROCEDURES. SEE BEFORE OR AFTER ANY PROCEDURE THEY WOULD EITHER COME IN WITH PEOPLE WITH NO NAME TAGS OR PEOPLE IN SUITS, AND WHEN WE ASKED TO SEE HIM WE HAD TO GO TO WHERE EVER HE WAS AT PRESBYTERIAN OR MONTEFIORE HOSPITAL OTHER THAN THAT THEY WOULD SCHEDULE HER TO SEE A PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT AND WOULD ALWAYS SCHEDULE US END OF THE DAY, AND WE WOULD WAIT HOURS TO TALK TO SOMEBODY. NONE OF THE DRS WOULD EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT (B)(6) IMPLANT WAS FALLING APART UNTIL (B)(6) STARTED COUGHING UP SEEDS AND STAPLES ETC. SO IN CLOSING I DON'T THINK MY WIFE SHOULD HAVE HAD TO FIGHT AND BEAT CANCER TWICE, AND THEN 10 YEARS LATER DIE AND BE RESUSCITATED TO GET EVEN HALF OF THE TRUTH AS TO WHAT IS EVEN GOING ON WITH HER HEALTH CARE AND FOR ANYONE TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT THIS IMPLANT IS ERODING AND COMING OUT THROUGH HER AIRWAY WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE FOR LIFE TO REINFORCE HER LUNG. AND BECAUSE SHE IS NOW IN THIS PREDICAMENT SHE MAY HAVE TO HAVE THESE PROCEDURES FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE WELL HOW MUCH OF HER LIFE SHE MAY HAVE LEFT? BECAUSE TOO, TWO CORPORATE ENTITIES WERE TRYING TO MERGE AND NEITHER ONE WANTS TO ADDRESS THE REAL ISSUES HERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION IN THIS MATTER.

SO IMMEDIATELY I WENT BACK TO THE HOSPITAL, AS SOON AS I WENT THROUGH THE I.C.U. DOORS, DR. (B)(6) JUMPED UP AND STATED IT WAS NOT ME, IT WAS THE SURGEON THAT LEFT THAT SUTURE IN HER LUNG, IT WAS THE SURGEON WHO DID THIS.

(B)(6) THEN STATED HE COULD NOT LEAVE (B)(6) UNTIL WEDNESDAY TO SEE HER, BUT IF HE WANTED TO TRANSPORT ME DOWN THERE TO HIM BY AMBULANCE CAUSE THE WEATHER WAS TOO BAD TO FLY HER DOWN THERE. THEN DR. (B)(6) SAID NO SHE IS TOO CRITICAL TO TRANSPORT THERE SO I HAD TO HAVE THE NURSE CALL DR. (B)(6) TO GET THE ORDERS TO TRANSFER HER AND ALL HER RECORDS TO DR. (B)(6).

SO HE AND THE I.C.U. NURSE STATED TO STAY AROUND BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE TO SIGN SOME AUTHORIZATION FORMS BEFORE SURGERY. I WAITED OUTSIDE THE I.C.U. DOORS ALL NIGHT NEITHER OF THEM EVER CAME? FINALLY, AROUND 8AM, I DEMANDED TO SEE MY WIFE THE NURSE SAID SHE WAS IN RECOVERY. THE DR DID THE SURGERY BUT HE LEFT, I THEN SAID THAT HE LEFT WITHOUT MY SIGNATURE OR EVEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT RESULTS, THE SURGERY OR ANYTHING?

FINALLY, DR (B)(6) AGREED TO REMOVE THE MESH, MY INDICES OF INFLAMMATION IMPROVED, BUT SHE BECAME CRITICAL OF ME, POSTULATING THAT POINT TENDERNESS I HAVE ON DEEP PENETRATION IS DUE TO MY HX OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE, WHEN SHE WAS UNAWARE OF THE SPECIFICS OF THAT HX, HAVING NEVER COLLECTED IT.

AFTER REVIEWING MY COMPLAINT, THEY STATED THAT MY COMPLAINT WAS OUTSIDE THE PARAMETERS OF THEIR INFORMAL COMPLAINT RESOLUTION PROCESS BECAUSE THE ISSUES PRESENTED IN MY COMPLAINT ARE REGARDING ISSUES OVERSEEN BY THIS AGENCY. MY LIFE HAS TAKEN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL DUE TO A PRODUCT THAT WAS PUT IN MY BODY ON (B)(6) 2013. THE PRODUCT WAS A BIOLOGICAL MESH THAT WAS FROM A COMPANY CALLED LIFECELL. I HAD TO DO THE RESEARCH BECAUSE THE DR WOULD NOT TELL ME WHERE HE HAD RECEIVED IT FROM. I HAD AN INJURY AT WORK WHICH AT THAT TIME REQUIRED ME TO HAVE SURGERY TO REPAIR AN ABDOMINAL FASCIA TEAR. I NEVER HAD A HERNIA EVER. THE DR THAT DID THE SURGERY DID VERY LITTLE EXPLAINING OF THIS PRODUCT TO ME. MY FIRST SURGERY WAS ON (B)(6) 2013. I WAS INFORMED THAT A 23 X 25 SHEET OF STRATTICE BIOLOGICAL MESH WAS PLACED IN MY ABDOMEN TO COVER A TEAR. THE PIECE OF MATERIAL WAS SO BIG YOU COULD SEE THE CORNERS OF THIS PRODUCT STICKING OUT ON THE SIDES OF MY ABDOMEN LIKE A HUGE SHEET OF PAPER, BEING PLACED THERE. MY ABDOMEN STARTED TO SWELL IN AN ENORMOUSLY SIZE AND THE SEVERE PAIN THAT STARTED RIGHT AFTER TOOK A TOLL ON MY ABILITY TO FUNCTION. I HAD FEVERS, COULD NOT WALK, COULDN'T BE LEFT ALONE. I HAD TO HAVE ASSISTANCE WITH DAILY TASK. I REPORTED THIS TO THE PHYSICIAN AT THE TIME TO INFORM HIM THAT I WAS GETTING EXTREMELY SICK. THROWING UP, COULDN'T EAT DUE TO THE SWELLING AND HOW IT CAUSED MORE PAIN WHEN I DID EAT OR EVEN MOVE AROUND. THIS HAD GONE ON UNTIL (B)(6) 2014. AT THIS POINT IS WHEN THE DR DECIDED TO DO ANOTHER SURGERY. THIS SURGERY WAS TO REMOVE THE MESH DUE TO ADVERSE EVENTS. I'M A l&I PATIENT HE REMINDED ME ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS AND STATED THAT THE FIRST SURGERY COST A LOT OF MONEY AND THE HORRIBLE COMPANY (B)(6) WAS NOT GOING TO APPROVE ANOTHER SURGERY. I ASKED HIM AM I SUPPOSED TO LIVE LIKE THIS UNTIL I DIE. HE INFORMED ME HE WOULD CONTACT (B)(6) TO REQUEST APPROVAL FOR ANOTHER SURGERY BUT HE WAS NOT GOING TO GET PAID FOR THE SECOND SURGERY IN THE AMOUNT OF WHAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY COST. HE INFORMED ME THAT THE COMPANY WAS SLOW PAYING THEM AND THIS IS WHY HE DID NOT LIKE TAKING l&I PATIENTS. I ASKED HIM WHY DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME ON THEIR LIST IF THIS IS THE CASE. I WAS STUNNED BUT DESPERATE BECAUSE THE PAIN WAS SO SEVERE. IF HE WAS TO DO A SECOND SURGERY, WHICH HE WAS TRYING TO GET AN APPROVAL IT WOULD BE THE SAME THING FOR HIM. HE STATED THEY TAKE A LONG TIME TO PAY AND IT COST A LOT TO HAVE TO GO BACK IN TO REMOVE THE MESH. THAT WENT ON FOR WEEKS. I BECAME SICKER AND SICKER AND CONTINUED TO INFORM THE DR OF THIS. AT THIS POINT HE DECIDED TO GO IN SO HE SAID AND REMOVED THE MESH. THIS SECOND SURGERY OCCURRED ON (B)(6) 2014. AFTER THE SECOND SURGERY I BECAME EXTREMELY ILL. THE SYMPTOMS HAD WORSENED. THE FEVERS WERE HIGH; PAIN WAS WORSE THAN I EXPERIENCED PRIOR. I WAS DRIPPING FROM THE WAIST DOWN DUE TO THIS PRODUCT HAVING A MIND OF ITS OWN. WALKING WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND TO MOVE CAUSED GRIEF AND I THOUGHT I WOULD DIE. I ASKED THE DR WHERE DID YOU REMOVE THE MESH AND HOW MUCH. IF HE EVER DONE A SURGERY LIKE THIS AND HE NEVER ANSWERED THE QUESTION AND I EVEN WROTE HIM 3 EMAILS BEGGING HIM TO TELL ME. HE NEVER RESPONDED. CALLED HIS OFFICE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE WHEN I CAN COME IN AND HE STATED THAT THERE IS NOTHING ELSE HE CAN DO FOR ME AND I HAD TO SEE MY PRIMARY DR. I EXPLAINED TO HIM HE PUT THE MESH IN AND TOOK IT OUT. ""SO HE SAID"" I NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH WAS TAKEN OUT AND WHERE. I RECENTLY FOUND A PROGRESS REPORT STATING THAT HE DIDN'T REMOVE THE MESH THAT HE DRAINED THE FLUID OUT. HE STATED THAT HE DID. I WAS PUT TO SLEEP AND HAD ANOTHER SURGERY AS IF IT WAS REMOVED. THIS IS WHAT THE PROGRESS REPORT STATED. AFTER THAT SECOND SURGERY LIFE WAS AND STILL IS UNBEARABLE. CALLED AND CALLED THE DR EXPLAINING THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG AND HE INFORMED ME THAT IS, WAS ALL IN MY HEAD AND I NEEDED TO LET MY BODY HEAL. WHICH I DID FOR A FEW MONTHS. I SHOWED UP IN HIS OFFICE TO SHOW HIM AND HE HAS SEEN HOW EXTENDED I WAS THAT I WAS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE. HE STATED THAT MY ABDOMEN WAS HEALING. I GOT EVEN SICKER AND AFTER THAT LAST VISIT HE IGNORED ME. I KEPT MY ATTORNEY UP TO DATE ON ALL OF THIS ( l&I ATTORNEY). I INFORMED THEM THAT HE SAID HE WOULD NOT SET ANYMORE APPOINTMENTS WITH ME AND STATED IN ONE OF HIS REPORTS THAT I WAS RELEASED FROM HIS CARE. HE INFORMED ME THAT HE WOULD NOT TAKE ANOTHER l&I PATIENT BECAUSE I WAS THE WORST CASE HE HAS HAD. THIS WAS NOT MY FAULT THAT MY BODY REACTED TO A FOREIGN PRODUCT THAT HE PUT IN MY BODY THAT CAUSED MY LIFE A LIVING HELL. NOT ABLE TO BE INTIMATE WITH MY HUSBAND AS A WIFE, NOT ABLE TO WALK WITHOUT ASSISTANCE, NOT ABLE TO LIVE LIFE LIKE I DID PRIOR OR EVEN WORK. I CAN BARELY SIT AND STAND FOR SHORT PERIODS AT A TIME. MY LEGS, BACK AND BODY HURTS TILL I WANT AT TIMES TO BE PUT OUT OF MY MISERY. MY LIFE HAS TAKEN A DIRECTION IN DESPAIR. I HATE WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO ME. I HATE IT. DURING THIS TIME, HE RELEASED ME I HAD TO FIND ANOTHER SURGEON AND I WAS TURNED DOWN FROM SEVERAL SURGEONS WHO DID NOT WANT TO TAKE ME AS A PATIENT WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THAT I HAD THE PRODUCT BIOLOGICAL MESH PUT IN MY BODY AND REMOVED. THEY STATED THAT THE RISK WAS TOO HIGH AND THEY DIDN'T WANT ANY PARTS OF IT. I LIVED THIS WAY FROM THE SECOND SURGERY (B)(6) 2014 UNTIL (B)(6) 2015. MY ABILITY TO FUNCTION HAD DECREASED AND THE FEVERS IN MY ABDOMEN HAD WORSENED AND I CAN BARELY MOVE AT TIMES. THE PAIN STARTED GOING FROM THE ABDOMEN TO MY BACK AND LEGS, MY FEET AND MY COMPLETE BODY. MY BODY HURTS BEYOND BELIEF. I CALLED THE DR'S OFFICE AND ASKED HIM, WHERE DID HE BUY THE PRODUCT AND GOT NO ANSWER. I ASKED HIM WHAT DID HE DO TO ME. GOT NO ANSWER. NOW FROM (B)(6) BECOMING SICKER AND EVEN IN MORE SEVERE PAIN . I GOT EXTREMELY ANGRY AND MY LIFE TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORSE. I HAD TO FIND ANOTHER SURGEON WHICH I DID AND THANK GOD. HE STATED THAT HE HAS NEVER SEEN A BAD REACTION TO MESH IN THIS WAY BECAUSE HE NEVER HAD TO REMOVE IT, BUT THERE WERE CASES OF IT. HE TREATED ME FOR MONTHS AND TRIED TO GET (B)(6) TO PAY FOR THE SURGERY AND THEY DENIED ME AGAIN. FINALLY, THEY DID WHEN MY ATTORNEY FOR l&I CONTACTED THE BOARD. I WAS SO SICK AND HE DECIDED TO PERFORM THE SURGERY ON ME BECAUSE OF THE SWELLING, VOMITING AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS I WERE HAVING. THE NEW SURGEON STATED THAT HE COULD REMOVE THE MESH THAT HE COULD ONLY SEE. HE ASKED THE PRIOR DR FOR THE REPORTS AND HE DID NOT GET ALL THE REPORTS FROM HIM. THE REPORTS HE DID GET WERE NOT PROPERLY DOCUMENTED. HE DID NOT FIND INFORMATION ON WHERE IT WAS REMOVED. HE STATED HE NEEDED THEM TO SEE WHAT HE WAS DEALING WITH. SO HE COULD ONLY REMOVE WHAT HE COULD SEE BECAUSE THE REST HAD MIGRATED INTO MY ABDOMEN AND SYSTEM. HE ALSO FOUND THAT THE DR SEWED MY OBLIQUE MUSCLES TOGETHER WHICH WAS NOT NORMAL EITHER. HE EXPLAINED HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER AS A RECONSTRUCTIVE PLASTIC SURGEON. EVER. HE ALSO SAID THAT PLAYED A HUGE FACTOR AS WELL IN MY SEVERE LEVEL OF PAIN. THE PAIN THROUGHOUT MY BODY IS NOT NORMAL AND IT'S SO SEVERE TODAY I BARELY FUNCTION. IT HAS WORSENED. I HAD TO DO THE RESEARCH TO FIND OUT WHAT COMPANY HE BOUGHT HIS PRODUCT FROM AND I DID. MY LIFE SHOULD NOT BE LIKE THIS OVER A FASCIA TEAR. I'M (B)(6) WHO WAS HAPPY, ACTIVE AND JUST LOVING LIFE AND NOW I CAN BARELY MOVE AND FEEL SO HOPELESS. I'M JUST BREATHING. I CALLED THE COMPANY AND GOT AHOLD OF THE GUY WHO SOLD THE PRODUCT TO MY DR AND HE SAID THIS WAS NOT THEIR PROBLEM. I EVEN CALLED BACK LIKE I WAS SOMEONE ELSE AND TOLD HIM THAT I WAS FROM THE HOSPITAL, AND HAD A SICK PATIENT THAT HAPPENS PRODUCT PUT IN THEIR BODY AND THE PATIENT HAD BEEN SICK FOR A LONG TIME. HE EXPLAINED THIS PRODUCT REACTS IN EVERYONE'S BODY DIFFERENTLY AND IT IS A RISK. I HAVE HIS NAME. I NEED HELP, I'M SEVERELY ILL AND HURT BEYOND BELIEF. NO ONE SHOULD WAKE UP AND LIVE WITH THIS TYPE OF PAIN DAY IN AND OUT. I AM SADDENED MY LIFE TOOK THIS DIRECTION BUT SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. LIFECELL WHICH I HAVE REPORTS HAVE BEEN ON THE HOT SEAT BEFORE BECAUSE OF THEIR PRODUCTS. MY DR IN 2013, AND 2014 DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT MY LIFE. HE DIDN'T CARE. HE WAS TOO CONCERNED HOW HE WAS GETTING PAID. I HAVE ATTACHED A LIST OF MY PAIN MEDICATION AND MEDICINE THAT I HAVE BEEN ON DUE TO THIS NIGHTMARE. THE PAIN MEDICINE DOESN'T WORK. NOTHING TAKES THIS AWAY. ALL I CAN TRY AND DO NOW IS PUT MY BODY IN A RELAXED STATE. I HAVE FOUND ANOTHER ARTICLE OF A LADY WHO HAS GONE THROUGH SOMETHING SIMILAR. I TRIED TO LOCATE HER. I DIDN'T WANT TO SEEM LIKE A CRAZY PERSON BUT SOMEONE ELSE SUFFERED SUCH AS I. I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD BAN ALL MESH PRODUCTS. THE WAY THIS HAS AFFECTED MY LIFE NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH SUCH DIFFICULTIES DAY IN AND DAY OUT. IT'S NOT ONLY ME THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTED, REALIZING HOW THIS TAKES A TOLL ON YOUR FAMILY AS WELL AND NO ONE CAN DO ANYTHING TO HELP YOU BECAUSE THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND. DOCTORS SEEM TO DOWNPLAY THESE ISSUES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH THE COMPLICATIONS THAT THIS IS CAUSING A PATIENT. HOW CAN YOU FIND A PRODUCT TO PUT IN SOMEONE'S BODY AND NOT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT IS A BORN PRODUCT THERE CAN BE HUGE COMPLICATIONS FROM THAT AND NOT HAVING TREATMENT FOR IT. THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ANYONE. THE PATIENT SUFFERS, PROVING TIME AFTER TIME THAT SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH THEM AND GOING TO DOCTOR AFTER DOCTOR AFTER DOCTOR TO BE TOLD THEY CANNOT FIND ANYTHING IS EXTREMELY INSULTING. DOCTORS ARE CONSTANTLY DOING CASE STUDIES ON PATIENTS WITH NEW PRODUCTS THAT ARE COMING OUT, JUST BECAUSE YOU TEST AN ANIMAL WITH SUCH A PRODUCT THE HUMAN BODY IS MUCH DIFFERENT. BIOLOGICAL MESH, SYNTHETIC MESH AND ANY OTHER BORN PRODUCT THAT IS PLACED INTO SOMEONE'S BODY MAY REACT TOTALLY DIFFERENT. YOU MAY PLACE THE PRODUCT IN ONE PERSON'S BODY THAT MAY NOT HAVE ANY SIDE EFFECTS . HOWEVER, YOU CAN PLAY SOMETHING AND ANOTHER PERSON'S BODY AND THEY CAN END UP EXTREMELY SICK OR MAY DIE. THE DOCTOR THAT DID MY SURGERY DID NOT GIVE ME ANY OPTIONS NOR DID HE EXPLAIN TO ME ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. HE DID NOT EVEN EXPLAIN THE COMPLICATIONS IF HE REMOVED THE MESH. ONCE I GOT VERY SICK, HE TURNED HIS BACK AND AVOIDED THE WHOLE SITUATION. ALSO THE MISTAKE OF SEWING BY OBLIQUE MUSCLES TOGETHER. IF HE WOULD ONLY LOOK INTO THE SITUATION AND NOT AVOIDED ME, WHEN I WAS TELLING HIM I WAS SICK I FEEL THAT I WOULD NOT BE IN THIS POSITION. HE COULD HAVE ALSO EXPLAINED THAT THERE WERE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS BY REMOVING THE PRODUCT. HE COULD NOT KEEP IT INSIDE MY ABDOMEN BECAUSE I WAS VERY ILL. DOCTORS ARE TO INFORM PATIENTS OF THE GOOD AND BAD SIDES OF A SURGERY. THEY ARE TO EDUCATE THE PATIENT OF A PRODUCT THAT THEY MAY USE IN THAT PERSON'S BODY. HE DID NONE OF THAT. I'M SUFFERING DAY IN AND OUT. MY HUSBAND IS DEALING WITH SOMETHING THAT IS SO FAR OUT OF HIS REACH HE CAN'T HELP ME. I ASKED THAT DR WHAT IF THIS WAS YOUR WIFE OR DAUGHTER. NO REPLY. WHEN I INFORMED THE DR THAT I WAS GOING DOWNHILL HE DISREGARDED ME TOTALLY. PUSHED THE PROBLEM AWAY. NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY OF THE OTHER DOCTORS DID NOT WANT TO SEE ME, THEY KEPT REFERRING ME BACK TO HIM SO THIS MESH STAYED IN MY BODY UNTIL I FOUND THE SECOND SURGEON. NO ONE WOULD HELP ME UNTIL I MET THE SECOND SURGEON. I DID TELL MY NEW DOCTOR THAT BY HIS HELP I UNDERSTAND DUE TO THE LONG WAIT OF THIS PRODUCT BEING IN MY BODY HE WOULD NOT BE THE CAUSE OF ANY OF THIS. HE DID WHAT HE COULD. THIS BIOLOGICAL MESH (STRATTICE) IS A NIGHTMARE. ALL I CAN DO NOW IS PRAY THAT GOD GIVES ME TIME HERE. READ THE ARTICLES ABOUT MESH REMOVAL. JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE A HERNIA DOES NOT MEAN IT COULD NOT AFFECT YOU THE SAME WAY. I ATTACHED ANOTHER ARTICLE OF A LADY WHO HAD THE SAME SYMPTOMS LIKE I HAVE.

(B)(6) AT (B)(6). I AM HOPING THAT THIS LETTER WILL BE ENOUGH TO LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION SO IT MAY PREVENT OTHERS FROM HAVING TO GO THROUGH WHAT I DID AND NOW HAVE TO LIVE WITH. I BECAME DR. (B)(6) PT BACK IN 2008, CHIEF COMPLAINT WAS URINARY PROBLEMS. I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH STRESS INCONTINENCE. IN (B)(6) OF 2010 SHE STARTED A SERIES OF COLLAGEN INJECTIONS TO TREAT THIS PROBLEM. INJECTIONS WERE GIVEN ON 6 DIFFERENT DATES: (B)(6) 2010, (B)(6) 2011, AND CONSIDERED ONE DAY SURGICAL PROCEDURES. I SAW NO BENEFIT OR IMPROVEMENT SO THE OTHER OPTION SHE TOLD ME ABOUT WAS INSERTION OF A PUBOVAGINAL SLING. DR. (B)(6) PERFORMED THE SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2014 AT (B)(6)MEDICAL CENTER. I STAYED OVERNIGHT AND NEXT DAY WAS SENT HOME WITH A PRESCRIPTION. ONCE HOME AND MORE ALERT, I REALIZED THE SCRIPT WAS FOR HYDRO CORDON. MY CHART CLEARLY STATES I HAVE AN ALLERGY TO THIS MEDICINE BUT THIS WAS OVERLOOKED BY DR. (B)(6). I CALLED TO LET THEM KNOW AND A DIFFERENT SCRIPT WAS GIVEN. I EXPERIENCED BURNING SENSATION, BLOOD WITH CATHETERIZATION, LOWER ABDOMINAL PAIN AND BLOATING. ON A RETURN VISIT, DR. (B)(6) FELT THE SLING MIGHT BE TOO TIGHT SO SHE RECOMMEND I GO IN FOR A SECOND SURGICAL PROCEDURE CALLED INDWELLING FOLEY CATHETER PLACEMENT DUE TO THE CHRONIC RETENTION OF URINE. SURGERY WAS PERFORMED ON (B)(6) 2014. PRIOR TO THE SECOND PROCEDURE I ONCE AGAIN REMINDED THE NURSES THAT I WAS ALLERGIC TO THE MEDICATION HYDRO CORDON SO THEY PLACED AN ALERT TAG ON MY OPERATING ROOM GOWN. I WAS TOLD I WOULD STAY OVERNIGHT BUT INSTEAD I WAS RELEASED LATER THAT DAY. I REMAINED IN THE RECOVERY ROOM FOR 2 1/2 HRS THEN TAKEN TO ANOTHER ROOM WHERE MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO VISIT. I WAS EXTREMELY DROWSY, SLURRING MY WORDS, ETC., THAT CONCERNED MY HUSBAND SO HE ASKED WHAT THEY HAD GIVEN ME FOR PAIN MEDS, THEY SAID VICODIN. THAT IS WHEN MY HUSBAND SAID THAT VICODIN IS IN THE SAME CLASS FAMILY OF HYDROCODON AND I AM NOT TO BE GIVEN THAT. THE NURSE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TO ASK ABOUT IT LATER TO RETURN AND ADMIT HE WAS RIGHT BUT BY THAT TIME IT WAS TOO LATE, I HAD BEEN GIVEN THE MEDS VIA IV DRIP. I WAS IN NO CONDITION TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL AND MY HUSBAND VOICED HIS CONCERN AS WELL BUT THEY SEEMED TO BE IN A HURRY TO LEAVE AS I WAS THE LAST PT OF THE DAY TO BE DISCHARGED (5:15) LIGHTS HAD BEEN TURNED OFF AND DISCHARGE PAPERS WERE HANDED OUT REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT IT TOOK 2 NURSES TO HELP ME GET DRESSED. I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME WAKING UP, I EXPERIENCED CHEST PAIN, WAS VERY WEAK AND DIZZY. I EXPERIENCED PAIN ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY RIB AND HAD DIFFICULTY BREATHING YET THEY RELEASED ME EVEN THOUGH I TOLD THEM I WASN'T STABLE AND DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT AND CLEARLY COULD NOT WALK ON MY OWN. MY HUSBAND TOOK ME HOME AFTER THE NURSES CHECKED WITH DR. (B)(6) WHO TOLD THEM I WAS TO BE RELEASED. I HAD A F/U VISIT TO REMOVE THE PACKING IN HER OFFICE. I SAT IN THE ROOM FOR OVER AN HOUR WAITING FOR HER TO COME IN AFTER TRIAGE COMPLETED THEIR QUESTIONS, I FELT VERY WEAK AND SICKLY BUT I WAITED PATIENTLY THINKING I WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO ASK QUESTIONS REGARDING MY CONCERNS. ONCE THE DR FINALLY CAME IN, SHE APPEARED RUSHED AND STANDOFFISH. I NEEDED ANSWERS BUT WHEN I TRIED TO ASK HER ANYTHING SHE IGNORED MY QUESTIONS. I NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO DISCUSS ANYTHING WITH HER. SHE HAD A COLD ATTITUDE, WAS DRESSED IN JOGGING CLOTHING, (VERY UNPROFESSIONAL I MIGHT ADD) AND TOLD ME TO DROP MY DRAWERS. I TRIED TO EXPLAIN HOW I WAS GIVEN THE WRONG MEDS ETC BUT SHE IGNORED THAT. AFTER THE PACKING WAS OUT SHE SAID I WILL SEE YOU ON MONDAY TO TAKE THE FOLEY OUT AND BEGAN TO WALK AWAY. I WAS TAKEN BACK BY HOW SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO SHOW ANY CONCERN SO I SAID ""IS THAT IT?"" YUP SHE REPLIED, I THEN SAID ""BUT I STILL CAN'T URINATE, SHE TOLD ME TO JUST CONTINUE TO SELF CATH AND THEN WALKED AWAY. I FELT INSULTED, WAS UPSET WITH HER ATTITUDE AND FELT EXTREMELY NEGLECTED. BEFORE THE FIRST SURGERY, I COULD ELIMINATE ON MY OWN, AFTER THE SURGERY I HAD TO USE A CATHETER TO RELIEVE MYSELF, CLEARLY I HAD A REASON TO BE VERY UPSET AND THE RIGHT TO HAVE MY QUESTIONS ANSWERED IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER. THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE HAS LEFT ME FEELING SELF CONSCIOUS, SHAME, FRUSTRATED AND ISOLATED FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THE SECOND SURGERY WAS SUPPOSE TO REDUCE THE TENSION ON THE SLING BUT THAT SURGERY ALSO WENT WRONG. I HAD TO CONTINUE TO SELF CATHETER. I ONCE AGAIN TRIED TO GET ANSWERS FROM DR. (B)(6) BUT THIS DIDN'T SEEM TO WORRY HER AT ALL AND WAS TOLD TO CONTINUE TO USE THE MANUAL METHOD TO RELIEVE MYSELF ALONG WITH WEARING PADS AND UNDERGARMENTS. THIS WAS VERY UPSETTING TO HEAR. FROM (B)(6), I HAD TO GO TO THE ER 3 DIFFERENT TIMES. PRIOR TO THE ER VISIT, I ATTEMPTED TO GET AN APPT TO SEE HER ONLY TO FIND OUT I COULDN'T GET IN FOR AN APPT, SO HAD TO RESORT TO GO TO THE ER. ONCE AGAIN I WAS UPSET AND FELT NEGLECTED BY THIS DR WHO DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE OR BE CONCERNED WITH MY PROBLEMS. I STRONGLY FEEL SHE MESSED UP THE SURGERY AND NOW I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES. AFTER MUCH FRUSTRATION, PAIN AND DISCOMFORT, I DECIDED TO GET A SECOND OPINION AND ULTIMATELY A THIRD DR. (B)(6), MD EXAMINED ME ON (B)(6) 2014 AND SAID IT APPEARED THE SLING HAD BEEN REMOVED BUT DR. (B)(6) TOLD ME SHE DID NOT REMOVE IT. TEST ALSO FOUND I HAD BLOOD IN MY URINE, BLOOD CLOTS, CATHETER INFECTION, BLOOD IN FOLEY. THE CATHETER WAS REPLACED AND I WAS PUT ON MORE ANTIBIOTIC. ON ANOTHER VISIT TO DR. (B)(6) I BROUGHT IN A PIECE OF GAUZE THAT I HAD FOUND ON MY PAD. I HAD TO CONTINUE TO SELF CATH, AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE A STAPH INFECTION FOR WHICH I WAS PRESCRIBED MORE MEDICATION. THE INFECTION LASTED FOR MONTHS WITH 9 ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIBED DURING THAT TIME. WHEN I REACHED A POINT WHERE DR. (B)(6) FELT HE HAD LITTLE OPTIONS LEFT TO OFFER ME; I FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO SEEK A SPECIALIST IN THE (B)(6) AREA 4 HRS AWAY FROM HOME. I FELT I NEEDED ANSWERS AND HAVING TO WEAR UNDERGARMENTS AND SELF CATH FOR LIFE WAS NOT SOMETHING I WAS WILLING TO COPE WITH. (B)(6) 2015 I SAW DRS (B)(6). I AM CURRENTLY UNDER THEIR CARE AND WILL REMAIN THEIR PT UNTIL THIS MATTER IS RESOLVED. THEY ARE WONDERFUL CARING PHYSICIANS THAT HAVE GIVEN ME A SENSE OF PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE, SECURITY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR WHICH I LACKED WITH DR. (B)(6). AFTER A COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW WITH ME, DR. (B)(6) FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO FURTHER EXAMINE ME IN THE HOSPITAL. ON (B)(6) 2015 I WAS EXAMINED IN THE OPERATING ROOM BY DR. (B)(6). IT WAS FOUND THAT I HAD BLADDER DAMAGE FROM THE MULTIPLE SLING SURGERIES, SCAR TISSUE AND BULGING URETHRA SWELLING. THE DR CANNOT SEE THE SLING THAT DR. (B)(6) INSISTS IS STILL THERE (SHE TOLD ME THAT ON THE SECOND SURGERY SHE CUT AND TIED THE SLING.)",,,,3.0,2016/10/20,ETHICON GYNECARE MESH,MESH,ETHICON,,,,,,,,,I,,,,,,*,,FTL,,*,,,

IN THE MEAN TIME, I WAS ABLE TO GET MEDICATED AND GOT A PCP HE TOLD ME TO SEE A UROLOGIST OR GENERAL SURGEON. THEN I GOT A LETTER IN THE MAIL SAYING MY PCP IS DONE HE IS RETIRING AT THE SUDDEN. WENT TO A UROLOGIST 4 TIMES 45MIN. AWAY (CAR RIDE WAS VERY PAINFUL) AND HE DID NOTHING BUT TOLD ME TO MAKE AN APPT WITH A GENERAL SURGEON WHICH WAS IN THE SAME OFFICE.

SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS LATER, I WAS (B)(6) WHEN MY DOCTOR DID A PARTIAL HYSTERECTOMY AND SHE (THE DR) TOLD ME SHE WOULD TACK UP MY BLADDER. AFTER THE OPERATION IN 1994, MY DR (DR (B)(6)) INFORMED ME EVERYTHING WAS JUST FINE. MY DR NEVER TOLD ME SHE WAS PUTTING IN A VAGINAL MESH. THERE WERE NO PAPERS THAT I SIGNED TO STATE THAT AN EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCT WAS BEING PUT INSIDE ME. NEVER DID. THE DR ""NEVER"" TOLD ME ANYTHING ABOUT A MESH. TWO YEARS LATER, I FELL DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS. I STARTED BLEEDING VAGINALLY AND I CALLED MY OB-GYN RIGHT AWAY (NEW DR). SHE EXAMINED ME AND GOT REALLY UPSET ABOUT WHAT SHE SAW. SHE CALLED MANY DOCTORS ON THE PHONE WHILE I WAS STILL IN THE ROOM THERE, LAYING DOWN WITH THE WHITE SHEET OVER ME. AFTER ABOUT 8 MINUTES, SHE TOLD ME THAT ""I NEEDED TO GO TO (B)(6) TO A SPECIALIST THE NEXT MORNING (EARLY 8AM)."" THE NEXT DAY, MY HUSBAND AND I WENT DOWN THERE. IT WAS THEN THAT I WAS TOLD THAT A VAGINAL MESH WAS INSIDE ME. THE DR SAID IT HAS EATEN MY VAGINAL VAULT AND MY VAGINA. HE WANTED TO OPERATE ON ME THE NEXT MORNING. I ASKED ""IF I COULD GO HOME TO (B)(6) AND THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING."" THE SPECIALIST SAID THAT I COULD GO BACK HOME, BUT I WOULD BE DEAD WITHIN THE WEEK. I WOULD NEVER LIVE ANY LONGER THAN A COUPLE DAYS. HE (DR) SAID THAT THERE WAS OUTSIDE AIR THAT WAS GOING STRAIGHT INTO MY BODY. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S SO BAD, BUT THE DR WAS EXTREMELY CONCERNED. WE DECIDED TO STAY THERE AND HAVE THE OPERATION. THEY TOLD US IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 1-1 1/2 HOURS FOR THE OPERATION. IT TOOK OVER 6 1/2 HRS FOR THIS OPERATION. THE DR SAID IT WAS LIKE GETTING MELTED BUBBLE GUM OUT OF FRIZZY HAIR. THE DR SCRAPED, SNIPPED, CUT AND TRIED TO REMOVE AS MUCH VAGINAL MESH THAT I HAD. IT HAD TOUCHED EVERYTHING, LIKE MY INTESTINES. THE DR SAW A ""HOLE WHERE THE MESH WAS EATING A HOLE IN MY INTESTINES."" DR FIXED IT BEFORE IT WENT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. DR HAD TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT MY INTESTINES AND PUT IT ON MY STOMACH TO SEARCH FOR ANY OTHER HOLES. THEN THE DR PUT IT ALL BACK IN MY GUT AND PATCHED HOLE. THEY HAD TO CUT GOOD TISSUE TO GET RID OF THIS MESH. I WAS SCRAPED AND CUT ALL OVER IN THE INSIDE AND CUT UP, SNIPPED WHEN NEEDED. THEY LEFT TWO INSTRUMENTS INSIDE ME BY ACCIDENT. I WAS REALLY SICK. REALLY SICK AFTER THE OPERATION. I SPENT AT LEAST ONE WEEK IN THE HOSPITAL THEN WENT HOME. IT TOOK ME MONTHS TO RECOVER, BUT I WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN ON BOTH SIDES WHERE THE OVARIES ARE BUT I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD GO AWAY. I HAD INTENSE PAIN IN MY PELVIC FLOOR AND WAITING FOR IT TO HEAL - IT NEVER DID AS OF (B)(6) 2016, MY PELVIC FLOOR REMAINS A 10 IN PAIN. IN 2013, I HAD MY OVARIES TAKEN OUT. WHEN THE DR LOOKED AT THEM, HE SAID THAT THERE WERE UNHEALED SLASHES IN EACH OVARY. I CRIED TO DR (B)(6) TO TAKE THEM OUT. THAT'S 17 YEARS OF TERRIBLE PAIN ON MY SIDE (EACH SIDE). THE PELVIC FLOOR IS STILL REALLY PAINFUL. FROM 0-10, IT'S A 10 PLUS IF LAYING DOWN. IT IS A 10 PLUS WHEN TRYING TO DO ACTIVITIES. NORMAL HOUSE CLEANING, DOING DISHES - ANYTHING 10 PLUS. I NO LONGER HAVE PAIN ON MY SIDES SINCE THE OVARIES WERE TAKEN OUT. DR (B)(6) SAID I HAD A COUPLE OF INSTRUMENTS INSIDE ME TOO - LIKE CLAMPS OR SUCH. HE SAID THAT MUST HAVE BEEN FROM MY 1996 OPERATION. HE TOLD ME TO JUST LIVE WITH IT. MY INTESTINES ARE COMPLETELY COVERED WITH ADHESIONS. IT IS VERY SEVERE. I LEARNED THAT THE DOCTORS WON'T OPERATE ON THEM. I JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT. LIVE WITH SEVERE ADHESIONS ON MY INTESTINES AND I'VE LOST OVER 60 LBS SINCE THEN. I HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH EATING. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THIS IS CONNECTED - NOBODY WILL SAY. NOT SURE ABOUT MY LIVER AND KIDNEYS AFTER THE SURGERY. BUT BEFORE THE MESH, I WAS EXTREMELY HEALTHY IN BOTH LIVER AND KIDNEYS. I AM HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY RIGHT KIDNEY AND MY LIVER. THIS IS AFTER MY VAGINA MESH SURGERIES. OH, YES AFTER 1996 - 2012, I HAD 4 MORE OPERATIONS AND SURGERIES TO FIX AND TAKE OUT MORE MESH. IN 2013, I HAD THE OVARIES OUT AND MORE MESH OUT. IT'S BEEN A NIGHTMARE. MY LIFE WITH MY HUSBAND OF OVER 25 YEARS ENDED THE DAY I TOLD HIM THAT I REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A VAGINA AND WE COULDN'T HAVE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. I OFFERED THAT WE STILL COULD HAVE SEX, BUT DIFFERENTLY. TWO MINUTES AFTER HE FOUND THIS OUT, HE MOVED OUT OF OUR BEDROOM TO AN EMPTY BEDROOM ACROSS THE HALL. WE NEVER SLEPT TOGETHER AGAIN (SIDE BY SIDE). HE STOPPED ALL TOUCHING ME AND CALLED ME (HORRIBLE) NAMES LIKE USELESS, USED UP, NOT A WOMAN AND MANY MORE DEMEANING NAMES. I ASKED THAT WE GO TO A COUNSELOR BUT HE REFUSED. INSTEAD, HE KICKED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE, SAID EVERYTHING WAS HIS. HE TOOK THE HOUSE INCLUDING THE KIDS. I HAD GOTTEN VERY ILL MENTALLY BECAUSE I COULDN'T TAKE IT. HE MOVED HIS GIRLFRIEND IN THE HOUSE AND THEN HE BOUGHT HER A NEW HOUSE IN 2009. I RECEIVED DIVORCE PAPER AT THE FIRST OF 2010 ((B)(6) 2010). WE WERE DIVORCED (B)(6) 2010 AND MY HUSBAND GOT 98% OF EVERYTHING AND I MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN MAY BE 2%. THIS WAS ""2 WEEKS SHY OF 34 YEARS OF MARRIAGE."" HE (MY ""EX"" HUSBAND) TAUGHT MY 5 CHILDREN THAT THEY SHOULDN'T TALK TO ME OR WRITE ME. THEY DON'T. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE OR WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE OR SOUND LIKE. HAVE NOT SEEN THEM SINCE 2010. MY WHOLE LIFE WENT UPSIDE DOWN WITH THIS VAGINA MESH. I AM GLAD THAT I AM NOT DEAD AND NOBODY WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS MESH. I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT THIS MESH WAS PUT INTO WOMEN WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE BEFORE THE FDA EVEN APPROVED IT. TWO YEARS BEFORE, IT WAS APPROVED. PLEASE DO SOMETHING WITH ""BARD PHARM."" THEY KNEW WHAT THEY DID WAS WRONG. I WAS A TEST RAT. THERE ARE STILL 2 OR 3 MEDICAL DEVICES INSIDE ME AND NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE THEM OUT. JUST LIVE WITH IT. ALL OF IT THEY TELL ME. MY VAGINA IS PERMANENT - EVERYTHING IS PERMANENT. VAGINAL MESH: THE PELVIC PAIN IS LIKE THIS: IF YOU WERE CUTTING UP HOT PEPPERS AND THEN YOU RUBBED YOUR EYES, THAT'S HOW MY PELVIC FLOOR FEELS 24 HRS, 7 DAYS A WEEK. I HAD AN OPERATION BECAUSE THE ""BARD"" MESH WRAPPED AROUND MY UTERUS. MY RIGHT KIDNEY STOPPED WORKING. WHEN THEY WENT IN, THEY HAD TO CUT THE ""BARD"" MESH THAT HAD TANGLED MY UTERUS. LUCKILY MY UTERUS WORKED. MY KIDNEY AND BLADDER WORKED TOO. THIS IS UTERUS ""BARD"" MESH WAS TAKEN OUT. PRODUCT DISSOLVED INTO MY BODY, EATING EVERYTHING IT TOUCHED AND MORE. ADVERSE EVENTS: I ALMOST DIED AND WHAT WAS IN ME WAS LIFE THREATENING. I AM DISABLED NOW AND THIS VAGINAL MESH CAUSED PAINFUL PERMANENT DAMAGE. IT'S A LIFE SENTENCE OF PAIN. I THINK THAT IT'S AFFECTED BOTH MY LIVER AND KIDNEY. I KNOW IT HAS AFFECTED MY INTESTINES AND I KEEP LOSING WEIGHT AND MY BLOOD SUGAR IS LOW. I THINK ALL THE SEVERE ADHESIONS ARE ADDING TO THE PROBLEM. ON (B)(6) 2016, I WAS PART OF A LEGAL ACTION AGAINST ""BARD PHARM."" I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I WAS PART OF 696 PEOPLE THAT HAD TROUBLE WITH THE ""BARD"" MESH. IT WAS LIKE A GROUP ACTION, SO THEY COULD PAY WOMEN LESS THEN IF THEY WENT TO COURT ALONE. WE WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS - GROUP ""1"" - WAS MY GROUP. THERE WERE AROUND 200 OR LESS. GROUP ""2"" - THEY WERE WOMEN WHO SIGNED THE PAPERS SO THEY COULD GET (B)(6), NO QUESTIONS ASKED. THERE WERE 496 WOMEN WHO SIGNED A SECRECY PAPER, A PAPER SAYING IT WAS A PELVIC MESH (MINE WAS A VAGINAL MESH); 496 WOMEN WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT STUFF IS GOING TO DO TO THEM WITH NO RECOURSE. THEY WERE WARNED NOT TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS CASE AND THERE WOULD BE LEGAL ACTION. MY GROUP ""1"" PEOPLE, FOR WHICH I WAS IN, WAS MADE UP OF WOMEN WHO HAD TO HAVE SURGERY BECAUSE THE MESH WAS EATING AWAY AT THEM TOO. THEY ALL HAD MEDICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE MESH. THEY ALL HAD ONE OR MORE SURGERIES THAT REQUIRED ANESTHESIA. THERE WAS A POINT SYSTEM YOU GOT 40 POINTS FOR 1 EXPLANT AND 1-2-3-4 OR 5 BECAUSE OF YOUR AGE. I'M OVER 50, SO I GET 1 POINT. FIVE POINTS MEANT YOU WERE YOUNG WHEN ALL THIS STUFF IS HAPPENING TO YOU. THE LAW FIRM REFUSED TO ACCEPT THAT I HAD MORE THAN 1 EXPLANT AND I REALLY HAD IN 1996 EXPLANT AND THEN 2 MORE EXPLANTS WITH 3 MORE SURGERIES TO REPAIR MY UTERUS AND THEN TO TAKE OUT MY OVARIES. THEY WANTED ME TO SIGN THAT IT WAS A PELVIC MESH. I HAD A VAGINAL MESH AND TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT THAT COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY. IT WAS A SECRET, THERE WAS NO WAY I'M HIDING THIS. I REFUSED THE MONEY AND REFUSED TO SIGN THOSE PAPERS. I WISH I COULD YELL OUT TO THE WORLD THAT ""BARD"" PHARM IS OUT THERE AND THEY KNEW THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE PUT THAT VAGINAL MESH IN ME - 2 YEARS BEFORE IT WAS APPROVED. THEY KNEW THAT IN NOT TELLING ME WHAT THEY DID, CAUSED AN EXTREME DANGER TO ME AND WHAT ABOUT THE WOMEN? IF I HAD NOT FALLEN DOWN THE STAIRS IN 1996, MY DR SAID THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD BY THE END OF THE WEEK. IF I HAD DIED, THEY WOULD HAVE JUST BURIED ME AND ""BARD"" AND MY DR WHO PUT IT IN WITH THE DIRECTIONS FROM ""BARD"" WOULDN'T EVEN CARE. I'M AMAZED THAT THIS CAN HAPPEN. I WAS A LAB RAT THAT ONLY LIVES, BECAUSE I FELL DOWN MY STAIRS. HOW MANY WOMEN HAVE ""BARD"" DONE THIS TO AND NOT LIVED (LAB RATS)? HOW MANY WOMEN HAS ""BARD"" DONE THIS TO WHO HAVE SIGNED PAPERS FOR MONEY WITH THE PROMISE THAT THEY WON'T TELL ANYBODY. IT'S A COVER UP AND I'M REALLY ASHAMED OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. DOESN'T IT SAY ""FIRST DO NO HARM?"" WELL, THAT WENT OUT THE WINDOW. IF I CAN HELP YOU IN ANYWAY, I'LL HELP YOU. IF THERE IS ANYWAY TO GET THIS OUT TO WARN PEOPLE,/WOMEN WHO HAVE THIS TIME-BOMB INSIDE THEM, AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW IT COULD KILL THEM.

I WAS TOLD BY THE SECOND SURGEON THAT THE HERNIA REOCCURRED AND I DECIDED TO HAVE A SECOND SURGERY TO REPAIR. THIS TIME AN OPEN HERNIA SURGERY WAS PERFORMED. AT THE END OF MY RECOVERY FROM THE SECOND SURGERY I STILL FELT UNCOMFORTABLE. WE WAITED A FEW MORE MONTHS TO GIVE THE AREA TIME TO RECUPERATE BEFORE DIAGNOSING FURTHER. AFTER THIS TIME THE PAIN WAS INCREASING AND MY ABILITY TO PERFORM DAILY TASKS WAS DIMINISHING AS THE PAIN AND DISCOMFORT INCREASED. I STOPPED ALL ACTIVITIES, ESPECIALLY HARD WITH A (B)(6) SON. UPON FURTHER DIAGNOSIS AND CAT SCAN IT WAS DETERMINED I HAD A SEROMA IN MY RT GROIN. THIS WAS SAID TO POSSIBLY BE THE ISSUE, AS THEY COULD SOMETIMES FORM AFTER HERNIA SURGERY THE DOCTOR EXPLAINED. I HAD A PROCEDURE TO ATTEMPT TO DRAIN THE SEROMA, BUT IT WAS HARDENED TO THE POINT IT WAS UNABLE TO BE ASPIRATED. MEANWHILE THE PAIN INCREASED!

I HAD MY (B)(6) HEALTHCARE PROVIDER CHECK ME OVER AND SHE AGREED ""SOMETHING'S NOT JUST RIGHT."" ALSO SHE'S THE ONE THAT TOLD ME, NOT HOW MANY F/U APPOINTMENTS IT TOOK, (B)(6) PAID THEM WELL UNTIL I WAS DISCHARGED, WITH A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH, THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED. ON THE THIRD F/U APPOINTMENT, DOCTOR (B)(6) OFFICE CHARGED ME FOR THE THIRD APPOINTMENT AND THEY TOLD ME, IF ANYMORE F/U APPOINTMENTS WERE MADE, FROM THEIR OFFICE, I HAD TO PAY OUT OF THE NOSE. THERE'S BEEN NO MORE F/U APPOINTMENTS MADE FOR ME AND I AM LEFT HANGING OUT ON A BRANCH, ""WITH ALL THIS PAIN AND SUFFERING, EVERY DAY. IF I STAND TOO LONG, THE PAIN SOMETIMES GETS SHARPER AND MORE PAINFUL. WHEN I GO TO BED AND WHEN I FIRST LAY DOWN, IT'S THE SAME. AND, WHEN I SIT STILL, THE PAIN IS STILL THERE. I AM CONSTANTLY REMINDED, I HAVE PAIN AND SUFFERING, THAT'S FOR LIFE. ""I AM A LIFER, BECAUSE WHATEVER WENT WRONG, I AM TOTALLY PETRIFIED TO HAVE THEM TRY TO CORRECT THE HERNIA OPERATION FOR FEAR THEY MAY EVEN TAKE MY LIFE, JUST TO SHUT MY MOUTH. (B)(6)HOSPITAL IS WELL KNOWN SCHOOL FOR MEDICINE. NOW, THEY HAVE GONE TOTALLY ACADEMIC, A SCHOOL FOR DOCTORS AND THE ALIKE. UNKNOWINGLY, I SIGNED PAPERS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO KEEP BODY PARTS, IF LEFT OVER, FOR SCIENCE. ONE OTHER THING, THREE TIMES I ASK THE DOCTOR, ""DID YOU DO THE OPERATING ON ME OR DID YOU HAVE HELP? HE SAID, HE DID THE OPERATION. THEN ON THE THIRD F/U APPOINTMENT, I ASK HIM AWAY FROM THE SECOND APPOINTMENT, ""DID YOU ALONE, DO THE OPERATION ON ME AND THIS TIME, HE SAID, ""I HAD HELP."" THEN, THAT TOLD ME, IT WAS A STUDENT DOCTOR THAT DID THE OPERATION ON ME, WHICH ALSO TOLD ME, THEY PEGGED ME AS OLD AND USELESS, SO IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. THIS IS NOT JUST ANYTHING OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, THINGS LIKE THIS ARE A MATTER OF FACT. IT WAS BACK IN 2002, I BROKE MY HIP AND DOCTOR (B)(6) DID A WONDERFUL JOB, BECAUSE TO THIS DAY, I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH HIS WORK. THE ANSWER MIGHT BE, WHEN DOCTOR (B)(6) DID THE OPERATION ONE ME, (B)(6) HAD NOT GONE FULL ACADEMIC YET. WHEN I TOLD MY (B)(6) HEALTHCARE PROVIDER, I WAS SCHEDULED FOR A STRESS TEST BEFORE THE OPERATION, BECAUSE OF MY AGE, SHE TOLD ME TO STAY AWAY FROM RADIATION TESTING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I TRIED TO TALK (B)(6) OUT OF THE RADIATION TESTING, BUT THEY KEPT TELLING ME, THEY COULD NOT OPERATE ON ME UNLESS I DID. THEN, WHY WOULD THE (B)(6) TELL ME, THE RADIATION TESTING WAS, NOT NECESSARY. THE (B)(6) KNEW WELL HOW OLD I AM. SOMEBODY'S PROFANITY ME AROUND AND I AM THE ONE THAT SUFFERS EVERY DAY AND NIGHT. I THINK I AM A VICTIM OF EXPERIMENTATION AND WHILE THEY'RE LINING THEIR POCKETS WITH THE O'MIGHTY DOLLAR, I HAVE TO LIVE IN PAIN AND SUFFERING. THEN ABOUT THREE DAYS LATER, I CAME DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA. (B)(6) HOSPITAL HAS BEEN CITED FOR FILTH MORE THAN ONCE OVER THE YEARS, FROM THE NEWS. I MADE A LOT OF REQUEST FOR MY MEDICAL RECORDERS AND OF THE RECORDERS I HAVE STUDIED MY RECORDERS AND FOUND, SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN FALSIFIED. FOR INSTANCE, THEY MY DAD DYING OF HEART FAILURE, WHEN IN FACT, HE DIED IN 1938 IN A HOUSE FIRE. WHERE THEY GET SUCH INFO, IS BEYOND ME. IN THE MEAN TIME, WHILE ALL THE CONTROVERSY IS GOING ON. THE (B)(6) WANTED ME TO HAVE DOCTOR (B)(6) ORDER ME AN ULTRASOUND OF THE OPERATION. HE FLAT OUT SAID, ""YOU DON'T NEED AN ULTRASOUND AND REFUSED TO ORDER ONE FOR ME. AFTER I TOLD THE (B)(6), THE DOCTOR REFUSED TO ORDER AN ULTRASOUND THEY ORDERED ONE FOR ME AT (B)(6). A FEW DAYS LATER, I REQUESTED COPIES OF THE ULTRASOUND AT (B)(6) AND THEY GAVE ME A CD THAT THE (B)(6) SAID, THEY COULD NOT USE. I HOPE THIS INFO WILL BE USEFUL FOR SOME, TO THIS PROGRAM.

I FELT A SHARP STABBING PAIN IN MY RIGHT GROIN. A PLACE WHERE I HAVE HAD A HERNIA REPAIR BACK IN 2002 WITH TWO PIECES OF PROLENE MESH MADE BY ETHICON. THE COMPANY FAILED TO TAKE ME FOR MEDICAL HELP WITH AN ON THE JOB INJURY TIMELY. THE FOLLOWING DAY I WAS TAKEN INTO THE BAY CITY HOSPITALS EMERGENCY ROOM WHERE IT CONCLUDED A POSSIBLE HERNIA. I TOLD THE DOCTORS OF THE PREVIOUS MESH IN ME AND THEY DIRECTED ME TO A HERNIA SURGEON FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. TOOK ME UNTIL (B)(6) OF 2014 TO FIND A SURGEON WILLING TO EVALUATE ME. THE ORIGINAL SURGEON (B)(6) REFUSED TO TREAT ME WHEN HE SEEN MY CONDITION AND HIM FINDING OUT IT WAS A (B)(6) CASE. HE STATED ""THEY DON'T PAY, I WON'T GET PAID SO I WILL NOT SEE YOU...LEAVE MY OFFICE"" MY MOTHER WAS WITNESS AND ASKED HIM HOW HE COULD BE SO INCONSIDERATE AND NEGLECTFUL. IN (B)(6) I FOUND (B)(6). SURGEON OUT OF (B)(6). WHEN HE OPENED ME UP HE FOUND THE MESH HAD SHRUNK, ENCASED ITSELF AROUND ALL OF MY ARTERIES SPERMATIC CORD AND THE INGUINAL CANAL. HE HAD ALSO STATED THAT THE MESH HAD BECOME HARD AND BRITTLE INSIDE, CAUSING AN EDGE TO CURL UP AND ACT AS A RAZOR CONTINUOUSLY CUTTING MY INSIDES AND MY NERVES. THAT WAS THE DEBILITATING PAIN I WAS FEELING. UNFORTUNATELY THE MESH HAD BECOME PART OF MY INSIDES MEANING HE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN REMOVING ANY OF IT AND STATED HE DID ALL HE COULD DO. I WAS UNDER ANESTHESIA FOR 6 HOURS AND WAS BECOMING A RISK FOR FURTHER SURGERY TIME. INSTEAD THE ONLY THING HE COULD DO WAS CUT THE DEFECTIVE PIECE OF MESH OUT AND PLACE A PARIETEX PRO GRIP MESH OVER THE TOP OF THE DEFECTIVE MESH TO ACT AS A BARRIER BETWEEN THE JAGGED SHRIVELED, BROKEN MESH AND STOP IT FROM CAUSING FURTHER DAMAGE. IT HAS CUT ALL OF MY NERVES INSIDE, WRAPPING ITSELF AROUND MY SPERMATIC CORD CAUSING DEBILITATING, LIFELONG, PERMANENT DAMAGE TO MY NERVES IN MY GROIN AND PARTS OF MY LEG. MAINLY THE ILIOINGUINAL NERVE. ITS A MAIN NERVE RUNNING THROUGH THAT REGION OF THE BODY. EVERYDAY I SUFFER AND AM TOLD THE ONLY TREATMENT FOR ME IS SHOTS DIRECTLY INTO THE ILIOINGUINAL NERVE ITSELF. VERY PAINFUL, VERY TEMPORARY AND EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE PAIN SHOTS, THAT ONLY IMPROVE MY QUALITY OF LIFE FOR LITERALLY 3 DAYS. THE FIRST TWO DAYS ARE SPENT ON THE COUCH WITH AN ICE PACK BECAUSE IT IS SO PAINFUL TO HAVE A 4 INCH NEEDLE STUCK INTO A NERVE IN YOUR GROIN. I URGE YOU TO BAN THESE HERNIA MESHES. I HAVE NO QUALITY OF LIFE. DEPRESSED ALL THE TIME. THIS PERMANENT INJURY CONSUMES ME AT ALL TIMES AND EVEN DISRUPTS MY RELATIONSHIPS AS ITS PAINFUL TO HAVE SEX. I AM (B)(6) AND HAVE A LOT OF YEARS AHEAD OF ME. SOMETIMES I CANNOT WORK DUE TO PAIN AND SUFFERING. I WAS TOLD BY MY DOCTORS I SHOULD BE ON DISABILITY OR PICK A CAREER THAT REQUIRES NO PHYSICAL DEPENDENCIES. I CAN'T SIT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME, STAND FOR TOO LONG, LIFT NO MORE THAN 40 POUNDS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE NOR CAN I HAVE ANY MORE SURGERIES. (B)(6) NOR CAN I AFFORD IT AT (B)(6). I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY FUTURE HOLDS, BUT I DO KNOW THAT THIS MESH IS THE WORST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME AND THE PAIN CAUSES MY BLOOD PRESSURE TO RISE WHERE MY FACE IS RED AND I SHAKE. I ALSO KNOW THAT IN 2000 THE FDA DID STUDIES ON THIS MESH, TWO YEARS BEFORE BEING PLACED IN ME AND BECAUSE DEGENERATION AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION ONLY HAPPENED IN 33% OF THE STUDY GROUP IT WAS CLEARED FOR USE AS A HERNIA REPAIR DEVICE. I REALLY WISH IT HAD NOT BEEN. EVERYDAY THAT I SUFFER, MY FAMILY SUFFERS WITH ME. I FEEL WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT I HAVE FOUND AT HOW TERRIBLE THIS MESH IS AND HOW I AM JUST ONE OUT OF THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THAT SILENTLY SUFFER.

I ALSO HAD INTENSE PAINS IN MY LOWER RIBS WHICH PREVENTED ME FROM WALKING AT TIMES. THE SURGEON THOUGHT THIS MAY BE DUE TO METAL PINS ATTACHED TO MY RIB TO KEEP THE MESH IN PLACE. FATIGUE. CHRONIC CONSTIPATION. BLOATING. LIMITED MOBILITY. I WAS PRESCRIBED PAIN MEDICATION PANTOZOL 40MG, PANADOL 500MG, VOLTAREN 75MG, NOVALGIN TRPF. AFTER 8 WEEKS I WAS STILL IN CHRONIC PAIN, ESPECIALLY BELOW MY RIBS. I WAS SENT TO THE PAIN CENTER WHO GAVE ME 2 SUCCESSIVE INJECTIONS INTO THE RIB AREA. UNFORTUNATELY THIS DID NOT RELIEVE THE PAIN. I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY WALKING UPRIGHT AT THIS STAGE BECAUSE OF THE CHRONIC PAIN. THE SURGEON PROF HANS BAER SUGGESTED REMOVAL OF THE METAL PINS HE THOUGHT WERE AGGRAVATING NERVES NEAR MY RIBS AND HIS PARTNER DR (B)(6) SUGGESTED REMOVAL OF THE MESH. SO AFTER 6 MONTHS OF CHRONIC PAIN, IT WAS AGREED THAT THE SURGEON WOULD REMOVE THE METAL PINS AND POSSIBLY THE MESH. SURGERY 2 ON (B)(6) 2015. SURGEON PROF H BAER. I FELT AWFUL AFTER THIS SURGERY. I HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO SOMETHING DURING SURGERY WHICH CAUSED SEVERE ITCHING FOR 2 DAYS. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS MORPHINE. I WAS ALSO HEAVILY STAPLED UP AND NOT SUTURED THIS TIME. PROF BAER SAID HE DID NOT REMOVE THE MESH BECAUSE HE COULD NOT SEE ANY PROBLEM WITH IT. HE DID CUT IT THOUGH. THE PAINS CAME BACK. THE LEFT RIB PAIN WAS LESS BUT BOTH LOWER RIBS WERE VERY SORE NOW. IT FELT LIKE SOMETHING WAS BADLY BRUISED OR BROKEN. DIFFICULTY BREATHING IN DEEP AND COUGHING. I HAD AN INTENSE PAIN THAT DEVELOPED IN MY LEFT SIDE WHICH DR (B)(6) THOUGHT MAY BE AN ADHESION TO MY COLON. DIFFICULTY PASSING STOOLS WITHOUT LAXATIVE. CONSTIPATION. FLATULENCE. BLOATING. RELIEVED ONLY WITH DAILY PROBIOTICS AND LAXATIVE. THE PAINS GOT PROGRESSIVELY WORSE AND I COULD FEEL THE MESH INSIDE ME ALL THE TIME. IT FELT LIKE I HAD A TIGHTENING HARDNESS IN MY ABDOMEN. PHYSIOTHERAPY MASSAGE HELPED SHORT TERM BUT THE TIGHTENING AND PAINS CAME BACK. MEDICATION WAS NOLVAGIN 500MG. I HAD TO SEE A DR ON A TRIP TO THE (B)(6) DUE TO INTENSE PAIN, WHO PRESCRIBED ME DIAZEPAM, AND CO-CODEINE TO HELP WITH THE PAIN. AFTER 6 MONTHS OF CHRONIC PAIN, DR (B)(6) CONFIRMED THAT THE MESH NEEDED TO BE REMOVED. HE THOUGHT IT MAY HAVE SHRUNK AND HAD A FOREIGN BODY REACTION TO IT. HE HAD DONE 20 REMOVALS PREVIOUSLY IN ANOTHER HOSPITAL AND WAS CONFIDENT HE COULD GET IT OUT. SURGERY 3 ON (B)(6) 2016. SURGEON DR (B)(6) REMOVAL OF MESH IN 2 PARTS AND HERNIA REPAIRED SURGICALLY. AFTER SUCCESSFUL REMOVAL BY DR (B)(6), PROF (B)(6) WAS ADAMANT THAT I WAS A RARE CASE AND THAT HE USED THE BEST, MOST EXPENSIVE MESH ON THE MARKET. DYNAMESH IPOM IS REPUTED TO HAVE LOWER REACTIONS AND SHRINKAGE, WHICH IS NOT THE CASE WITH MY IMPLANT. I SAID I WAS NOT A RARE CASE, THERE ARE LOTS OF MESH REJECTION CASES. HE WALKED OUT OF MY HOSPITAL ROOM. HIS JUNIOR DR (B)(6) LATER SAID THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE A SURGICAL REPAIR IN THE FIRST CASE. MESH SENT TO PATHOLOGY FOR TESTING, WHICH REPORTED SEVERE SCARRING AND FOREIGN BODY REACTIONS, 2 NEUROMAS AND 2 PARTS OF METAL PINS/FOREIGN OBJECT. I HAVE A COPY OF THE REPORT. THE ABDOMINAL PAINS HAVE IMPROVED BUT I AM STILL SUFFERING WITH CHRONIC LOWER RIB PAIN, BOWEL ISSUES, FATIGUE AND A GENERAL LACK IN WELLNESS. MY LIFE QUALITY HAS CONSIDERABLY DIMINISHED SINCE HAVING THE MESH IMPLANT. EVEN AFTER REMOVAL MY LIFE IS STILL NOT WHAT IT WAS BEFORE THE MESH. IF I KNEW THAT MESH COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE TO TEST THEIR NEW MESHES BEFORE USING THEM IN PATIENTS...I WOULD NEVER HAVE AGREED TO MESH IMPLANTATION.

IT HAS BEEN WORKING OUT OF MY BODY UNTIL THIS PRESENT DAY. WHEN IT APPEARS IT LOOKS SIMILAR TO A LARGE BLACKHEAD AND NEARLY THE SAME COLOR. AS IT BEGINS TO COME OUT I CAN SQUEEZE AROUND IT AND SOMETIMES GET IT TO COME COMPLETELY OUT. AT TIMES THERE MAY BE TWO OR THREE AREAS WORKING OUT AT THE SAME TIME. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR APPROX. 35 YEARS. I SUPPOSE MY MEDICAL RECORDS WOULD PIN DOWN THE EXACT TIME. I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE SURGERY AND THE REPAIR HAS HELD UP GOOD.

IT WAS AN INGUINAL HERNIA LOCATED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY GROIN. THIS WAS OUTPATIENT SURGERY. THE MESH USED WAS PROLENE MESH 3"" X 6"". WITHIN TWO TO FIVE DAYS' POST-SURGERY, A BULGE CAME UP RIGHT BESIDE THE WOUND. AFTER THE FIRST POST-SURGERY APPOINTMENT WITH DR. (B)(6), SHE SENT ME FOR AN ULTRASOUND AND CT SCAN. DR. (B)(6) ALSO TRIED TO PUT A NEEDLE IN THE BULGE TO TRY TO DRAW OFF WHAT WAS IN IT BUT NOTHING WOULD COME OUT. I HAD APPROXIMATELY THREE POST-SURGERY APPOINTMENTS. ON MY LAST POST-SURGERY APPOINTMENT DR. (B)(6) TOLD ME IT WAS A HEMATOMA AND IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT GO AWAY. I WAS THEN RELEASED FROM HER CARE. SO FOR THREE YEARS AND TWO MONTHS, I LIVED WITH THE PAIN AND DISCOMFORT. I ALWAYS SAT WITH A PILLOW ON MY LAP AND I WAS IN FEAR SOMETHING MIGHT TOUCH IT OR HURT IT MORE THAN IT ALREADY WAS. THE BULGE WAS ALWAYS VERY SENSITIVE TO THE TOUCH. I HAD TO WEAR VERY LOOSE FITTING CLOTHES. WHENEVER I WENT TO A DOCTOR I WOULD ALWAYS TELL THEM AHEAD OF TIME NOT TO PUSH THERE BECAUSE I HAVE A HEMATOMA. ON (B)(6) 2014, MY HUSBAND TOOK ME TO THE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE I WAS VERY SICK AND DRY HEAVING. LATE THAT EVENING THEY DETERMINED WHAT I WAS TOLD WAS A HEMATOMA WAS IN FACT A FEMORAL HERNIA. A PART OF MY BOWEL WAS PROTRUDING THROUGH A HOLE WHERE MY HERNIA REPAIR WAS PERFORMED. I SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE HOSPITAL AND THE NEXT MORNING (B)(6) 2014 DR. (B)(6) OPERATED ON ME. WHEN I SAW HIM AFTER THE SURGERY I ASKED HIM IF IT WAS A HEMATOMA. HE SAID NO IT WASN'T. HE CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS A FEMORAL HERNIA. THIS WAS ONLY THE SECOND FEMORAL HERNIA HE HAD EVER TREATED IN HIS MANY YEARS IN PRACTICE. HE REPAIRED THE FEMORAL HERNIA WITH A BARD MESH PLUG.

I UNDERWENT LAPAROSCOPIC HERNIA PROCEDURE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO FIX MY INGUINAL HERNIA. WHEN I AWOKE THE SURGEON INFORMED ME THAT HE REPAIRED BOTH SIDES, RIGHT AND LEFT WITH MESH. EVER SINCE I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING SHARP PAINS AND UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS IN MY PELVIS, HIP AND GROIN AREA. MY RIGHT SIDE WAS SO BAD THAT I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO LIFT MY LEG TO GET IN THE CAR. I WASN'T ABLE TO BEND II THE WAY DOWN AND TIE MY OWN SHOE. I WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO LIFT MY LEG WITHOUT THE AID OF MY OWN HANDS PULLING IT UP. LAST YEAR MY SYMPTOMS WORSENED ON MY LEFT SIDE. I HAVE PICTURES TO SHOW AND PROVE WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON. MY LEFT SIDE FELT LIKE A BRILLO PAD WAS BREAKING UP INTO PIECES UNDER THE SURFACE OF MY SKIN. I HAD ABOUT 4-5 LARGE NOTICEABLE LUMPS UNDER MY SKIN AND WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE, I COULDN'T PUT ON PANTS OR UNDERWEAR WITHOUT BEING IN PAIN. IT WAS DEPRESSING. I WAS NOT ABLE TO HAVE SEX FOR MONTHS EVEN BEFORE THE BULGE GOT BIGGER. AND STILL TO THIS PRESENT DAY. AFTER ANOTHER MONTH OR SO THE LUMPS TURNED INTO ONE BIG BULGE EXTENDING FROM MY HIP TO MY GROIN AREA. AFTER ANOTHER MONTH OR SO THE BULGE TURNED PURPLE, RED AND BLACK. I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IN (B)(6) 2016 AND THEY DID A CAT SCAN. THEY SAID THEY SAW SCAR TISSUE. BY THEN THE BULGE WAS LEAKING IN 2 DIFFERENT AREAS. ONE IN MY HIP AREA AND THE OTHER IN MY GROIN AREA. THEY PRESCRIBED ME ANTIBIOTICS AND PAIN MEDICINE. ABOUT A MONTH OR SO LATER I WAS SEEN BY MY PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR WHO SENT A REFERRAL OVER TO A SURGEON TO HAVE THINGS LOOKED AT AND POSSIBLY HAVE THE MESH REMOVED. ONCE I HAD TALKED TO THE SURGEON HE SAID THE BEST OPTION FOR ME WAS TO HAVE MY MEDICAL RECORDS SENT FROM THE HOSPITAL WHERE THE INITIAL PROCEDURE TOOK PLACE. (B)(6) MEDICAL CENTER WAS WHERE THE INITIAL LAPAROSCOPIC PROCEDURE TOOK PLACE BY SURGEON (B)(6) 2013. HE ALSO WARNED ME THAT THE BEST OPTION WAS TO HAVE AN EXTRACTION AND A LAPAROSCOPY DONE WHERE I WOULD HAVE TO WEAR A WOUND VAC FOR A MINIMUM OF 4-6 MONTHS WHILE THE INSIDE HEALS SECONDARILY. I LEARNED THAT THE MFR OF THE MESH WAS (B)(4). I HAVE MY MODEL NUMBER AND DATES OF EXPIRATION OF THE MESH PUT IN ME AS WELL FROM MY MEDICAL DOCUMENTS. MY SURGERY IS SCHEDULED FOR NEXT MONTH AND I HAVE BEEN IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS AS WELL. NO SEX! MY PERFORMANCE AT WORK HAS SLOWED DOWN NOTICEABLY. IT'S BEEN DEPRESSING TAKING ALL THIS PAIN MEDICATION THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK. I DON'T KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE TRAMADOL HAS BEEN TO OTHER PEOPLE, BUT IT HASN'T BEEN THAT GOOD FOR ME. I'VE HEARD THERE WAS SOME CLAIMS AGAINST (B)(4) AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS OF MESH AND SO I BEGAN TO DO SOME HOMEWORK. SURE ENOUGH (B)(4) MADE THE LIST OF DEFECTIVE MESH AMONG OTHERS. I CAN'T WORK WITH A WOUND VAC ON MUCH LESS DO EVERY DAY ACTIVITY LIKE I USED TO. I CAN'T PLAY WITH MY KIDS LIKE I USED TO. I CAN'T WORK LIKE I USED TO. AND I CAN BARELY TIE MY OWN SHOES BECAUSE OF THE INFECTED MESH (B)(4) HAS IN ME. I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS SINCE THE MESH WAS PUT IN ME. SHARP PAINS IN MY HIPS AND GROIN AREA. UNABLE TO LIFT MY LEG WITHOUT HELP. UNABLE TO STAND FOR PERIODS AT A TIME WITHOUT SHARP PAINS SHOOTING DOWN FROM MY HIP TO MY LEG MAKING MY LEG LITERALLY GIVE OUT UNLESS I SIT DOWN. THE WORSE IT'S GOTTEN IS RECENTLY WHEN I HAD TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE THE BULGE WAS SO BIG AND PAINFUL, NOT TO MENTION JUST DOWN RIGHT UNCOMFORTABLE I WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS, WHICH I WAS PRETTY GOOD AT. IT'S STILL DRAINING OUT OF TWO DIFFERENT AREAS TO THIS DAY AND I HAVE TO KEEP CHANGING BANDAGES AT THE VERY LEAST TWICE A DAY BECAUSE OF THE LEAKAGE. I HAVE AN UPCOMING SURGERY SCHEDULED FOR (B)(6) 2017 WHERE THE SURGEON TELLS ME I HAVE TO WEAR A WOUND VAC AFTERWARDS FOR AT LEAST 4-6 MONTHS! NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT AT ALL. HE ALSO TELLS ME THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO CUT THROUGH MY ABDOMEN AND THIS PROCEDURE WILL BE WORSE THAN WHAT I AM ALREADY GOING THROUGH! I WAS HOSPITALIZED ON (B)(6) 2013 FOR INTESTINAL BLOCKAGE DUE TO THE HERNIA MESH. I PLAN TO GO TO SCHEDULE A MEETING WITH TWO NEWS STATIONS NEXT MONTH BEFORE MY SURGERY TO LET PEOPLE KNOW NOT TO GET THIS PROCEDURE DONE USING THIS MFR (B)(4) AND THE COMPLICATIONS THAT COULD ARISE SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO GO THROUGH WITH ANY PROCEDURES THAT CONTAIN THE NAME (B)(4)!",,,,1.0,2017/02/26,PARIETEX,MESH,COVIDIEN,,,,,,,,,I,2017/06/01,TECR1510,,SMJ00794,,Y,,KDD,,I,,,

CAN'T SLEEP ON MY STOMACH LIKE BEFORE THE PRESSURE HURTS LIKE A SEWING MACHINE NEEDLE STOCKING ME. MY FAMILY AND BOYFRIEND ARE VERY CONCERNED CAUSE THEY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING EVERYDAY.

I TALKED TO MY FRIEND THAT'S AN EX-DETECTIVE HE WAS WONDERING WHY I COULDN'T SIT STILL AND WAS HOLDING MY STOMACH.

WHEN DOING SIT UPS ONE DAY I FELT A BURNING SENSATION IN MY RIGHT LOWER ABDOMEN AND I NOTICED I HAD DEVELOPED A HERNIA. I WENT TO A DOCTOR AND HE ADVISED TO GET IT REPAIRED BUT I WAITED ABOUT TWO YEARS BECAUSE I WAS HAVING NO PAIN BUT ONE DAY HIKING I STARTED TO HAVE REAL SHARP PAINS WHERE MY HERNIA WAS AND COULD BARELY WALK. I HAD THE HERNIA DONE ABOUT 1995 WITH (B)(6) IN (B)(6). WHEN I WOKE UP FROM THE OPERATION THE PAIN WAS INCREDIBLE AND I GOT VERY NAUSEATED BECAUSE I WAS TOTALLY PUT UNDER WHICH I WOULD NEVER DO AGAIN. I HAD AN INCISION TYPE SURGERY DONE. IT WAS NOT LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY. I ALSO HAD A LOT OF BACK PAIN WHEN I GOT UP BECAUSE I HAVE A BAD BACK AND NEED TO BE PROPPED UP WHEN LYING FLAT ON MY BACK AND WILL NEED TO DO SO NEXT TIME I HAVE AN OPERATION. I HAD ELECTRICAL NERVE AND BURNING PAINS GOING FROM MY GROIN AREA TO MY INNER THIGH AND OUTER THIGH ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MY ANKLE AFTER THE SURGERY PAIN WENT AWAY. WHEN I CALLED MY DOCTOR ALL HE TOLD ME WAS THE HERNIA WAS REPAIRED AND HE SEEMED TO CARE LESS ABOUT MY PAIN. HIS NAME WAS DR. (B)(6). I THEN WENT TO ONE OF THE BEST HERNIA DOCTORS IN THE STATE AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL IN (B)(6) BY THE NAME OF DR. (B)(6) WHO LIVES IN (B)(6) NOW AND HE CONFIRMED THE HERNIA HAD BEEN REPAIRED AND ANOTHER DOCTOR IN (B)(6) CONFIRMED THE SAME. DR. (B)(6) AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING HE COULD DO BECAUSE HE SAID THAT THE MESH BECOMES LIKE CEMENT AND GETS ENTANGLED LITERALLY IN THE FLESH AND HE REFERRED ME TO (B)(6) PAIN CLINIC WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY. ALL THEY ASKED ME WAS MY LEVEL OF PAIN AND THEY TOLD ME AFTER AWHILE I WOULD GET USED TO THE PAIN OVER TIME. I COULD NOT FIND ANYONE WHO WOULD TAKE OUT THE MESH. I WAS ADVISED BY I THINK DR. (B)(6) TO HAVE NEURO MASSAGE THERAPY WHICH I DID FOR MONTHS BUT THAT REALLY DID NOT DO ANYTHING FOR ME. I RAN INTO AN OLYMPIC RUNNER FROM (B)(6) WHO HAD A PROBLEM WITH HIS HERNIA AND HE WENT BACK TO A DOCTOR IN (B)(6) AND WHATEVER THE DOCTOR DID FOR HIM WAS CORRECTED. I WENT TO THIS SAME DOCTOR BECAUSE OF THE RESULTS HE HAD. THAT DOCTOR NOTICED A ROUND PIECE UNDER MY SKIN ABOUT THE SIZE OF A NAL HEAD WHERE THE HERNIA WAS DONE AND SHOT SOME KIND OF NERVE BLOCK WHICH REALLY FELT GOOD AND HE WENT BACK IN NOT TO RE-OPEN THE HERNIA BUT TO DO SOME KIND OF EXPLORATORY SURGERY WHICH WHEN FINISHED ACTUALLY STOPPED THE PAIN TOTALLY GOING DOWN MY LEG WHERE THE PAIN WAS NOW ONLY LOCATED IN THE INGUINAL AREA. THIS WAS ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO. ABOUT (B)(6) 2016 I WAS LYING FLAT ON MY BACK BRINGING MY RIGHT KNEE TO MY CHEST AND THEN PULLING IT OVER TO THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY WHICH IS A CHIROPRACTOR MOVE TO ADJUST MY BACK WHICH I DO EVERY DAY AND I THINK THAT CAUSED THE NERVE OR SCAR TISSUE TO GET CAUGHT IN THE MESH OR WHATEVER BECAUSE THAT DAY THE NERVE COMING FROM THE INGUINAL AREA ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MY THIGH TO MY ANKLE WAS SO BAD I COULD BARELY WALK. IT HAS GOTTEN WORSE SINCE THEN. I DON'T FEEL IT THAT MUCH IN THE MORNING BUT AFTER WALKING 20 MINUTES TO THE BEACH AND SWIMMING A MILE THE PAIN GETS QUITE INTENSE GOING DOWN MY LEG AND ACROSS MY BACK AND THEN I TAKE 1-2 ASPIRIN TO GET RID OF THE PAIN. I USE TO RUN IN 6K RACES EVEN AFTER THE HERNIA OPERATION WAS DONE BUT WITH DISCOMFORT. NOW IT WOULD KILL ME IF I TRIED IT.

I STILL HAVE PAIN IN THE AREA OF THE OPERATION EVEN AFTER HAVING A BIOLOGICAL MESH PLACED OVER THE AREA AND THE HERNIA HAS RECURRED.

GOT A SEVERE BACTERIAL INFECTION THAT WAS MELTING MY SKIN ON VAGINA AND LEFT ARM AREA. ITCHING LIKE SOME DOG WITH FLEES. HAD TO HAVE A 3PT BLOOD TRANSFUSION. GOT A HEMATOMA AND AN ABSCESS.

THEIR INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT THE HERNIA MESH MFRS KNOW OF THE LIFE-THREATENING COMPLICATIONS THEIR PRODUCTS CAN CAUSE BUT THEY DON'T ADEQUATELY WARN THE PUBLIC OR SURGEONS. IT ADHERES TO ABDOMINAL TISSUE AND MUSCLES THAT HAVE TO BE REMOVED WITH IT. I HAVE TO HOLD ON TO MY VANITY EVERY TIME I HAVE A BOWEL MOVEMENT LOOSE OR NOT. MORE THAN SURE THE UNCONTROLLABLE MUSCLE SPASMS THAT I HAVE (THAT MY DOCTOR HAVE TO GRAB AND HOLD SOMETIMES TO DO MY TRIGGER POINT INJECTIONS) ARE COMING FROM THE COATING(S) THE MFRS COAT THE POLYPROPYLENE WITH. THIS COATING WAS INTENDED TO BE ABSORBED BY THE BODY OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS TO YRS, BUT DUE TO THE COMPLICATIONS THAT POLYPROPYLENE WAS CAUSING WHEN IT CAME IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE BOWEL. THE DEMAND FOR COMPOSITE HERNIA MESH SKYROCKETED, SELLING FOR 15-20 TIMES MORE THAN AN UNCOATED POLYPROPYLENE MESH. WHEN ONE TYPE OF MESH CAUSED TOO MANY SIDE EFFECTS, THE COMPANY WOULD SIMPLY QUIT MFG THAT PARTICULAR MESH. I HAVE MOST AND SOMETIMES ALL OF THE COMPLICATIONS BEING INVESTIGATED. INFECTION, ADHESIONS, SEROMA AND ABSCESS DEVELOPMENT, FISTULAS, PROTRUSION, NON-HEALING WOUNDS, AND BOWEL PERFORATION. MOST OF THESE COMPLICATIONS CAN BE LIFE THREATENING OR LEAD TO PERMANENT DISABILITY.

I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU ALLOW SOMETHING THIS DANGEROUS TO GET LOOSE ON THE UNK PUBLIC. MY INFECTION WAS SO BAD THAT THEY WANTED TO INSERT A TUBE TO DRAIN IT. THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR SAID PUTTING THE TUBE IN WOULD CAUSE THE INFECTION TO SPREAD AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD WITHIN 2 WKS. I WOULD HAVE LET THEM INSERT IT IF MY DOCTOR HAD SAID I NEEDED IT BUT THANK GOD HE FIXED IT SO HE WAS OUT OF TOWN ON VACATION.

I WENT BACK TO THE SURGEON'S OFFICE ((B)(6)) AND THE SURGEON TOLD ME THE PAIN IN THE PELVIS WAS A NORMAL PART OF RECOVERY, BUT DID NOT HAVE AN ANSWER OF THE SYMPTOMS IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. THE SURGEON THEN GAVE ME A STEROID INJECTION IN MY PELVIS WHICH SEEMED TO NUMB MY PELVIS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY, BUT THE PELVIC PAIN RETURNED THAT NIGHT. IT WAS PERHAPS A WEEK OR SO LATER THAT THE BURNING PAIN IN MY LEGS AND ARMS BECAME SO INTENSE THAT I WENT TO MY GP WHO GAVE ME A SCRIPT (LYRICA, GABAPENTIN) AND SENT ME TO A RHEUMATOLOGIST, WHO DID SOME BLOOD TEST (WITH NO FINDINGS) AND SENT ME TO AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST, WHO DID MORE BLOOD WORK (WITH NO FINDINGS) AND THEY SENT ME TO THE SPECIALIST/NEUROLOGIST AT (B)(6). AFTER EXPLAINING THE SURGERY AND MY SYMPTOMS TO HIM, HE CHANGED MY MEDICATION TO ALLEVIATE THE BURNING PAIN AND ORDERED MULTIPLE BLOOD TEST (NO FINDINGS) AND THEN AFTER EXAMINING MY LEGS AND ARMS A SKIN BIOPSY WHICH REVEALED I HAD SMALL FIBER NEUROPATHY (IDIOPATHIC) WHICH WAS CAUSING ALL THE BURNING PAIN. AT THAT POINT, AND OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS HE CONTINUED TO ORDER MORE TEST WHICH PRODUCED NO RESULTS OR INDICATIONS ON WHAT WAS CAUSING THIS IDIOPATHIC SMALL FIBER NEUROPATHY, HE ORDERED GENETIC TESTING DONE, BUT AGAIN THE GENETIC TESTING OFFERED NO ANSWERS. DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS WHILE UNDER HIS CARE I HAVE ADDITIONALLY DEVELOPED PAINFUL AUTOIMMUNE SYMPTOMS THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE BODY (ALL JOINTS, INFLAMED, MINOR SWELLING, ETC.) THESE NEW SYMPTOMS WERE ONLY SUCCESSFULLY CONTROLLED WITH LARGE DOSES OF PREDNISONE. MY NEUROLOGIST HAS SENT ME TO TWO DIFFERENT RHEUMATOLOGIST SINCE THE ONSET OF THE NEW SYMPTOMS, BUT THEY COULD NOT FIND ANY POSITIVE INDICATION ON THEIR BLOOD WORK, THAT WOULD SUGGEST I HAVE ANY OF THE COMMON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. ALL THROUGH MY CARE WITH (B)(6), I KEPT ON ASKING IF ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS COULD BE RELATED TO THE HERNIA MESH THAT WAS IMPLANTED, AND THE ANSWER WAS ""PROBABLY NOT "" AND ""IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO PROVE"". IT WASN¿T UNTIL JUST RECENTLY THAT I RE-ASKED THE QUESTION TO MY NEUROLOGIST (BECAUSE WE HAVE NO MORE TESTS TO CONDUCT) THAT HE SAID THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT ALL OF THIS IS RELATED TO THE SURGICAL MESH, MY NEUROLOGIST HAS SINCE SENT ME TO A SURGEON ABOUT REPLACING THE MESH, AND THE SURGEON TOLD ME THAT I WOULD MOST LIKELY BE WORSE OFF TO HAVE IT REPLACED AND THAT HE WOULD NOT PERFORM THE SURGERY.

THE SPERMATIC CORD HAD TO BE FREED FROM THE MESH THAT ADHERE TO IT. TO REMOVE SCAR TISSUE, SURGERY DID HELP TO STOP THE SEVERE PAIN DURING SEX, BUT DID NOT STOP ALL COMPLICATIONS. HAD MY RIGHT TESTICLE PULLING UP INSIDE ME WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STAND, SIT OR WALK FOR LONGER THAN 15 MINS. I HAD A SURGERY IN 2018 WHICH THEY HAD TO DISSECT THE SCROTUM SACK, SUTURE DOWN THE RIGHT TESTICLE, REMOVED MOURNERS THAT WAS ENTANGLED IN THE MESH, FREE UP THE SPERMATIC CORD AGAIN, REMOVE SCAR TISSUE, AND SOME MESH.

LAPAROSCOPIC ASSESSMENT, ALONG THE INFRAUMBILICAL AND SUPRAPUBIC INCISION REVEALED NO OBVIOUS INJURY TO THE OMENTUM, BOWEL OR OTHER STRUCTURES. IT WAS NOTED THAT THERE WAS A PIECE OF OMENTUM THAT WAS ADHERENT TO THE UTEROOVARIAN LIGAMENT ON THE RIGHT SIDE. A SECOND 5 MM TROCAR WAS INSERTED INTO THE RIGHT LOWER QUADRANT UNDER DIRECT VISION. THE OMENTUM WAS THEN GRASPED WITH AN ATRAUMATIC GRASPER AND THIS WAS EXCISED OFF THE UTEROOVARIAN LIGAMENT WITH THE USE OF THE THUNDERBEAT SYSTEM USING THE COAGULATION SETTING.

THIS DISSECTION WAS EXTENDED TO THE LEFT SIDE TO LENGTH OF APPROX 1.5 CM BEFORE I WENT INTO A DEEPER TUNNEL.

I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS BEFORE THE MESH WAS PUT INTO MY BODY WITH MY LEGS OR ARMS. AFTER THE MESH, I HAD CONSTANT PAIN WHERE IT WAS PLACED. MY BOWELS BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN. I DEVELOPED WORSENING PAIN SYNDROMES LIKE THORACIC OUTLET SYNDROME. PIRIFORMIS SYNDROME, CUBITAL TUNNEL SYNDROME, ORCHIALGIA, SI JOINT PAIN, AND AUTOIMMUNE PROBLEMS SUCH AS POTS. AS I WRITE THIS, THE MESH IS BURNING, MY LEFT TESTICLE IS IN PAIN TRAVELING UP INTO MY STOMACH. THIS IS ALL THE RESULT OF MESH INTERACTING WITH MY BODY IN AN UNNATURAL AND UNPREDICTABLE FASHION. I WILL HAVE TO HAVE REPEATED SPERMATIC CORD DENERVATIONS TO TREAT PAIN FROM TESTICLES. IN ADDITION, I MAY HAVE TO REMOVE TESTICLE ALL TOGETHER. I CANNOT FLEX MY STOMACH, TWIST, OR EVEN USE PROPER POSTURE WITHOUT INTENSE PAIN IN MY STOMACH, SIDES, AND HIP. THE CHRONIC PAIN IS NOT RELIEVED BY HIGH DOSES OF LYRICA OR NSAIDS. I BELIEVE THESE HEALTH CONDITIONS MAY HAVE EXISTED SHOULD I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN MESH PLACED INSIDE ME, BUT THE MESH HAS MADE THEM SO BAD, THEY ALL REQUIRED SURGERY AND/OR HAVE LITTLE TO NO TREATMENT LIKE PIRIFORMIS SYNDROME AND SI JOINT PAIN. IN ADDITION, I HAVE TO TAKE 600 MG OF LYRICA AND MUSCLE RELAXERS DAILY JUST TO TRY AND COPE WITH THE PAIN. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT DURING COMMON RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES SUCH AS CT SCAN, IT HAS BEEN PROVEN MESH WILL CONTRACT WHICH CAN OPEN UP NEW HERNIAS OR PULL ON EMBEDDED NERVES. I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT MEDICAL SALES SHOULD NOT DICTATE WHAT SURGEONS CAN OFFER OR WHAT TRAINING THEY ARE PROVIDED. I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH WORK IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN MESH REPAIR FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT. MY ONLY THOUGHT IS THAT SURGEONS ARE ALL TRAINED IN THE SAME WAY THAT MESH REDUCES RECURRENCE RATES AND COMPLICATIONS ARE KEPT TO A MINIMUM. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT COMPLICATIONS ARE VERY SERIOUSLY DISABLING, CHRONIC, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE IMPLANTED MESH THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. WHEN NO DISCLOSURE IS EVER MADE THAT THE MESH IS NOT SAFE TO REMOVE AND/OR DUE DILIGENCE IS NOT PERFORMED BY MFR. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK THE FDA TO NO LONGER ALLOW PIGGY BACKING OF MEDICAL DEVICE APPROVALS ON TOP OF OTHER DEVICES THAT HAVE COME BEFORE THEM. EVERY DEVICE IS UNIQUE AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH WHEN IMPLANTED IN THE BODY. I HAVE HAD THREE HERNIA MESH PLACEMENTS WITH NONE OF THEM REDUCING PAIN AND/OR PREVENTING RECURRENT HERNIA FOR MORE THAN 6 MONTHS.

I DECIDED TO WAIT TO SEE MY SURGEON WHO IMPLANTED THE BARD COMPOSIX LP MESH IN 2009. THE FOLLOWING MONDAY 3 DAYS AFTER THE ER. REVISION SURGERY WAS SCHEDULED ASAP WITH MY SURGEON AND HIS PARTNER A MASTER SURGEON TO REMOVE THE FAILED MESH.

NO ONE BUT ME POINTED TO THE MESH AND I WAS TOLD IT WAS PROBABLY SOMETHING ELSE. BARD COMPOSIX LP WITH ECHO PS A POSITIONING BALLOON WAS A CLASS 2 RECALL. WHY IS THE SAME MESH WITHOUT NOT RECALLED? THIS MESH HAS WORSE COATING ON IT. EPTFE I ORDERED STICKER PAGE FROM MEDICAL RECORDS AND FOUND MORE INFO AFTER RESEARCHING. PERMANENT COATING NUMEROUS BARD HERNIA MESHES INCLUDE EXPANDED POLYTETETRAFLUOROETHYLENE (EPTFE) IN THEIR DESIGN, SUCH AS THE COMPOSIX KUGEL, COMPOSIX LP, COMPOSIX EX, VENTRALEX, AND VENTRIO HERNIA MESHES. EPTFE IS KNOWN TO CONTACT AT AN EVEN FASTER RATE THAN POLYPROPYLENE. AS A RESULT, THE MESH BEGINS TO CURL AND DEFORM AS THE EPTFE SHRINKS POST IMPLANTATION. ADDITIONALLY, EPTFE BREAKS DOWN IN THE PRESENCE OF BACTERIA. AS EPTFE BREAKS DOWN, IT CREATES SMALL NOOKS AND CRANNIES THAT HARBOR BACTERIA AND PROTECT THE BACTERIA FROM THE BODIES DEFENSE SYSTEM. THAT BACTERIA CAN THEN FORM WHAT IS KNOWN AS A BIOFILM AND CAUSE LONG TERM AND SYSTEMIC INFECTIONS. EPTFE ALSO INCREASES THE PERMANENT FOREIGN BODY LOAD, CREATING AN EVEN GREATER IMMUNE RESPONSE TO THE HERNIA MESH IMPLANT. THE INCREASED IMMUNE RESPONSE THEN CAUSES THE POLYPROPYLENE TO DEGRADE AT AN EVEN FASTER RATE. THE FDA HAS NOT RECALLED THIS DEVICE? I FIND THIS ABSURD.

I ENDED UP IN THE ER, LABS WERE DRAWN AND A CULTURE WAS TAKEN OF THE ABSCESS FLUID. I WAS PUT IN AN ANTIBIOTIC. WITHIN 24 HOURS MY INCISION STARTED TO OPEN; 24 HOURS LATER, MY IMPLANT AND UNINCORPORATED STRATTICE WAS EXPOSED. I WAS OUT OF TOWN SO HAD TO SEE A PLASTIC SURGEON THERE. HE IDENTIFIED THE STRATTICE AND REMOVED THE EXPOSED STRIPS. WITHIN A WEEK I SAW MY LOCAL PS AND HE REMOVED THE IMPLANT. TWO DAYS LATER AN ABSCESS APPEARED ON MY LEFT IMPLANT INCISION. TWO DAYS LATER MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. I HAD DRAIN TUBES THAT WERE REMOVED IN A COUPLE DAYS. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY I STARTED TO DISCHARGE A THICK, GREEN, MUCOUS. ALL CULTURES FROM DRAINAGE AND TISSUE AND ALL BLOOD TESTS SHOWED NO BACTERIA, NO FUNGUS, NO INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, ETC. MY INCISIONS STARTED TO OPEN AGAIN AND EVENTUALLY ANOTHER HOLE FORMED THROUGH MY RIGHT BREAST ALONG THE INCISION. FOR WEEKS I DEALT WITH EXTREME DISCHARGE (CHANGING BANDAGES 8-10 TIMES DAILY) AND SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DR. EVENTUALLY MY SURGEON SPOKE TO ALLERGAN REP AND A DECISION WAS MADE TO REMOVE MY BREAST TISSUE AND HOPEFULLY ANY DERMAL MATRIX-STRATTICE-CELLS THAT MAY HAVE INCORPORATED INTO MY TISSUE. DRAIN TUBES WERE LEFT AT THE INCISION SITE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER SURGERY THE GREEN DISCHARGE STOPPED. DRAINS WERE REMOVED AND THE RIGHT BREAST HEALED WELL. LEFT BREAST GOT CELLULITIS AND I WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSP WHERE I RECEIVED IV ANTIBIOTICS, BLOOD DRAW, CULTURE OF DISCHARGE FROM THE CELLULITIS AND AN ULTRASOUND. I WAS ASKED TO STAY IN THE HOSP BUT INSTEAD DECIDED TO GO TO AN INFUSION CENTER EVERY 12 HRS. THE FOLLOWING DAY MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOC SAID NO TO IV ANTIBIOTICS FOR FEAR OF C-DIFF. THEN THE LEFT INCISION STARTED TO OPEN UP AGAIN AND EVENTUALLY I HAD TO GO TO WOUND CARE DOC. HE ORDERED ME TO COMPLEX CARE AT THE HOSP FOR DAILY PACKING OF MY WOUND AND BANDAGE CHANGES. ON THIS DATE, (B)(6) 2019, I STILL HAVE AN OPEN WOUND, PACKING MATERIAL, AM ON ANTIBIOTICS AND DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M HEALING. I NOW FOUND OUT THAT MY CAPSULE WAS NOT COMPLETELY REMOVED BECAUSE MY PS SAID HE NEEDED IT OVER MY LUNGS. I FEAR THE STRATTICE IS STILL LEFT IN MY BODY AND IS CAUSING THIS HARM TO ME AS WELL AS THE DEFORMITY OF MY BREASTS. ALL DRS HAVE VERBALLY SUSPECTED THE PROBLEM TO BE DUE TO THE ADM. I WAS TOLD BY MY SURGEON'S OFFICE THAT ALLERGAN HAD FILED AN ADVERSE EVENT WITH THE FDA. TO DATE I DON'T SEE IT POSTED TO THE FDA SITE. TOO MANY TESTS AND CULTURES TO NAME. ALL TISSUE CULTURES AND BLOOD TESTS AND SERUM CULTURES CAME BACK NORMAL. I HAD NO INFECTION, NO FUNGUS, NO CANCER. I WAS NOT SICK AND EXPLANTING OR REACTING TO THIS PRODUCT.

I IMMEDIATELY EXPERIENCED ALL SORTS OF IMMUNE ISSUES, AND DUE TO THE MANUFACTURER NOT BEING HONEST ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT, MY SURGEON DID NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THE ISSUES I WAS HAVING WERE RELATED TO THE MESH. MY EYES WERE SWOLLEN LIKE AN ALLERGIC REACTION, I HAD TERRIBLE URINARY TRACT PAIN LIKE AN INFECTION. OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS, I BECAME EXTREMELY FATIGUED, MY GROIN HURT SO BAD WHERE MY LEGS MEET MY INNER HIPS I COULD BARELY RISE FROM A SITTING POSITION TO WALK. I DEVELOPED BRAIN FOG, MY HANDS AND FEET WOULD GO NUMB, MY VISION WENT DOWNHILL, AND IT WAS BASICALLY A CASCADE OF AUTOIMMUNE ISSUES TRIGGERED IMMEDIATELY UPON IMPLANT OF THIS TOXIC MATERIAL. I CAN SAY WITH 100% SURETY IT WAS DUE DIRECTLY TO THE MESH, AS WHEN I HAD IT REMOVED, MOST OF THE SYMPTOMS HAVE RESOLVED AND NOT COME BACK. I MAY HAVE A FEW REMAINING SYMPTOMS FOR MY LIFETIME, AND THAT IS WHY I FEEL IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT THE FDA LOOK INTO WHAT EXACTLY COMPRISES THIS MATERIAL AND HOW IT REACTS LONG TERM, OR IMMEDIATELY FOR THAT MATTER, IN A HUMAN BODY. THE 510K PROCESS IS REPEATEDLY SHOWING THAT ALLOWING MANUFACTURERS TO DO THEIR OWN EXTREMELY INADEQUATE AND BIASED STUDIES HAS DEVASTATING OUTCOMES FOR UNWITTING VICTIMS SUCH AS MYSELF. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO LIST EVERY SINGLE TEST I HAD BETWEEN THE YEARS OF 2016 TO 2019, WHEN I HAD THE MESH REMOVED. HOWEVER, I'D BE GLAD TO COMPILE THEM IF SOMEONE IS ACTUALLY LOOKING INTO THIS MATTER. I SOUGHT HELP FROM PRIMARY CARE, WHO WOULD RUN TEST SUCH AS ROUTINE BLOOD AND URINALYSIS, RHEUMATOLOGISTS FOR JOINT PAIN, NEUROLOGISTS FOR HANDS AND FEET GOING NUMB AND TINGLING, XRAYS, MRI'S, PHYSICAL THERAPY FOR NECK AND STOMACH CHARLEY HORSING, CHIROPRACTOR, MASSAGE THERAPIST, ACUPUNCTURIST, FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE, NEPHROLOGIST FOR KIDNEY PAIN, ENDOCRINOLOGIST TO CHECK MY THYROID/FATIGUE. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT IS MOST DEFINITELY CAUSES AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF SYMPTOMS THAT DON'T SEEM TO ALIGN WITH AND SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS. THE CLOSEST THING I CAN FIND TO MATCH WHAT I AM FEELING IS ASIA SYNDROME - AUTOIMMUNE SYNDROME INDUCED BY ADJUVANTS. THE FDA REALLY NEEDS TO LOOK INTO ACCEPTING THIS DIAGNOSIS AND HOW IT PERTAINS TO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS WHO BECOME VICTIM OF IT AND CAN'T GET ANY HELP FROM THEIR DOCTORS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT RECOGNIZED. IT IS CAUSING INCREDIBLE SUFFERING. THE DEVICE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN HAVING THEIR PRODUCTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS, AS THEIR PRODUCTS WOULD LIKELY ONLY BE USED AS A LIFESAVING MEASURE VERSUS A PRODUCT THAT IS SLAPPED INTO HUMAN BODIES JUST TO MAKE SURGERY ""EASIER."" SURGEONS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN TRAINED ON PROCEDURES IN WHICH THESE MEDICAL DEVICES ARE NOT NEEDED, AND WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THAT. WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE TOTALITY OF THE OUTCOME FOR THE PATIENT, NOT JUST ""DID IT HELP THE SPECIFIC THING THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO FIX.""

TAKING A HUGE TOLL ON MY HEALTH AND MENTAL STAMINA. THIS LAST ROUND OF CIPRO, CAUSED ME TO FEEL 90. CREAKY AND STIFF, TIRED, SORE, DAY 11 MY LEGS FELT LIKE LEAD, DAY 12 I WOKE UP WITH SEVERE NEUROPATHY FROM MY WAIST DOWN, MAKING IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WALK.

SO MUCH MORE TO THE STORY, BUT I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO LEARN FROM 3 OF MY DR.'S THAT IT WASN'T REPORTED THIS YEAR OR LAST. I WAS TOLD NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT CLASS OF ANTIBIOTIC, ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT NEXT STEP IS INVANZ (AND IT WOULD BE MY 3 RD ROUND IN A YEAR ) I CHOSE THAT AS THE LESS OF 2 EVILS. I REMEMBERED READING ABOUT PULLED TENDONS BUT NEVER NEUROPATHY! THIS IS A BIG DEAL !! AS NOT AN EXPECTED REACTION TO SUCH A FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED DRUG. I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING IT AS A WARNING ON PAPERWORK THAT CAME W/ DRUG FROM (B)(6). HAD TO RESEARCH ONLINE. WAS TOLD TO STOP TAKING IMMEDIATELY AND GO TO ER, IT TOOK ME A FEW DAYS AS I AM A HAIRDRESSER AND WAS TRYING TO GET OUT OF TOWN. BOTH OF MY REGULAR DR.'S WE'RE OUT OF TOWN AND I FELT THE COVERING DR.'S WE'RE BEING A LITTLE DRAMATIC, SO WANTED TO GIVE IT A FEW DAYS.

I CAN'T DRIVE, WORK, DO STAIRS, OR MY JOB FOR MORE THAN A FEW HOURS SEATED. I AM SLATED FOR A NEW NEURO AND NERVE TESTING WHICH I DON'T WANT TO DO BC OF HIGH RISK FOR INFECTION AND ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE. WAS TOLD BY MY PAIN MANAGEMENT NOT TO DO THAT. NOW I'M IN A QUANDARY BECAUSE IT'S MY WORD AGAINST THEIRS, BUT I AM AN EXERCISING, MOVING GAL, NOT A SEDATE LIFESTYLE, AND THAT HAS BEEN INSTANTLY TAKEN AWAY. NOW ISSUES WITH BOWELS, URINE LEAKS, SEXUAL FUNCTION, WALKING, STANDING, FALLING, BALANCE. NOT OKAY.

AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE NARRATIVE OF MY EXPERIENCE WRITTEN BELOW, THE DOCTOR OFFERED NO HELP AND I HAD TO DO MY OWN RESEARCH TO FIND A DOCTOR WHO COULD HELP ME. I'M WONDERING WHY THIS HERNIA MESH WAS EVEN APPROVED FOR USE INSIDE THE HUMAN BODY IN THE FIRST PLACE? WHY SHOULDN'T THE HERNIA MESHES BE LISTED AS A RISKY MEDICAL DEVICE? WHY AREN'T DOCTORS TRAINED ON HOW TO SCREEN PATIENTS FOR POTENTIAL PROBLEMS? I PRAY THAT YOU WILL TAKE MY STORY SERIOUSLY AND HELP MAKE SURE THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN TO ANYONE ELSE. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND I THANK YOU FOR WHATEVER YOU CAN DO. HERE IS A NARRATIVE OF MY EXPERIENCE: IN (B)(6) OF 2020, (B)(6), MD PERFORMED A LAPAROSCOPIC UMBILICAL CORD HERNIA REPAIR WITH POLYPROPYLENE MESH FOR A 1 CM DEFECT. I HAD DONE SOME RESEARCH AND EXPRESSED MY CONCERN ABOUT USING MESH, BUT DR. (B)(6) INSISTED THAT HE WAS USING A HIGH-QUALITY MESH AND THAT I WOULDN'T EVEN FEEL IT. HOWEVER, THE HERNIA SURGERY LEFT ME IN HORRIBLE PAIN! RIGHT AWAY I FELT INTENSE PAIN WHENEVER I DID ANY ACTIVITIES IN WHICH I MOVED MY ABDOMEN, INCLUDING SNEEZING, COUGHING, SWIMMING, SEX, ETC. I ALSO HAD PAINFUL SKIN LESIONS AS WELL. WHEN I RETURNED TO THE DOCTOR ON (B)(6), I TOLD HIM THAT I FELT LIKE APOLLO 13 ¿ ""HOUSTON, WE'VE HAD A PROBLEM."" BUT HE JUST CLAIMED THAT HIS PATIENTS DON'T GET PAIN AND TOLD ME THAT IF IT HURTS WHEN I SNEEZE, THEN I SHOULDN'T SNEEZE. HOWEVER, LIVING WITH A PAIN LEVEL OF 8/10 WAS NOT SOMETHING I WAS WILLING TO ENDURE, SO I STARTED DOING RESEARCH. I FOUND A (B)(6) VIDEO FROM (B)(6) TALKING ABOUT HERNIA MESH ISSUES AND DR. (B)(6), A HERNIA SPECIALIST FROM (B)(6) WAS FEATURED. SO, I CONTACTED HIS OFFICE AND HE ACTUALLY CALLED ME BACK, LOOKED AT MY OPERATIVE REPORT, AND SAID IT WAS EITHER THE MESH OR THE MESH STAPLES THAT WAS CAUSING MY PAIN. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER HEARD ABOUT NATURAL TISSUE REPAIR BECAUSE MY SURGEON HAD NEVER OFFERED ME THAT AS AN OPTION. DR. (B)(6) WAS MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP ME, BUT SINCE I LIVED ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN (B)(6), HE SUGGESTED THAT I FIND ANOTHER HERNIA SPECIALIST NEAR ME WHO IS EXPERIENCED WITH IDENTIFYING THE CAUSES OF POST-HERNIA SURGERY PAIN. THEN I DISCOVERED (B)(6) AND (B)(6) GROUPS FOR PEOPLE INJURED BY HERNIA MESH. I DISCOVERED A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION AND DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE MANY OTHER PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE ALSO ENDURING INCREDIBLE SUFFERING FOLLOWING HERNIA SURGERY. AFTER WATCHING A (B)(6) EPISODE WITH DR. (B)(6), MD FROM (B)(6) AND GETTING REFERRALS FROM THE (B)(6) GROUPS, I FELT MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT SEEING HIM IN ORDER TO FIND A SOLUTION TO MY INTENSE PAIN. DR. (B)(6) MET WITH ME ON TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, AND AFTER MY CONDITION WORSENED, DR. (B)(6) PERFORMED A ROBOTIC MESH REMOVAL SURGERY WITH NATURAL TISSUE REPAIR SIX WEEKS AGO ON (B)(6) 2021. DR. (B)(6) DISCOVERED ""EXTENSIVE ADHESIONS"" BETWEEN THE MESH, MY SMALL INTESTINES, AND OMENTUM. NOW I AM FEELING CLOSE TO 100% BETTER, AND EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A CHANCE OF HERNIA RECURRENCE, AT LEAST I HAVE MY LIFE BACK. I CAN BREATHE MUCH MORE EASILY AND I NO LONGER FEEL LIKE I HAVE A PYTHON WRAPPED AROUND MY ABDOMEN; I THANK GOD THAT THIS NIGHTMARE IS FINALLY OVER.

UPON AWAKENING FROM SURGERY EXCRUCIATING PAIN. SINCE THAT POINT I HAVE HAD 17 SURGICAL PROCEDURES/SURGERIES THAT INCLUDES FIVE REMOVALS OF MESH. I'VE HAD MULTIPLE INFECTIONS. IN 2014 I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME AND PUDENDAL NERVE DAMAGE. IN 2015 I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH OBTURATOR NERVE DAMAGE BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO CUT THE MESH OFF OF MY OBTURATOR FORAMEN WITH A BONE CUTTER. I'VE HAD MAJOR RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY OR INFECTIONS GONE HOME WITH CATHETERS. MY PAIN IS EVERY SINGLE DAY, IT'S AN ENTITY THAT LIVES INSIDE MY BODY EVEN THOUGH THEY THINK THEY MAY HAVE GOT ALL THE MESH OUT. THERE ARE DAYS WHERE IT FEELS LIKE I'M SITTING ON BROKEN GLASS, TODAY'S WHERE IT'S FILLED WITH RAZORS SLICING THROUGH ME. I CAN'T FORGET THE BUGS WITH THE RAZOR SHARP TEETH THAT RUN UP AND DOWN MY LEGS AND IN THE BACK OF MY BUTT. DAYS I FEEL LIKE I WANT TO CUT OFF MY FEET BECAUSE MY CRPS FLARES. THE WORST PAIN OF ALL IS THE PELVIC PAIN, IT'S LIKE THERE'S SOMEONE CRANKING MY PUBIC BONE IN AN OLD RUSTY VICE AND IT'S JUST CUTTING ME AT THE SAME TIME AS CRUSHING IT. ARE USED TO SAY THAT THE MESS WAS PROBABLY ALL GONE. THEY CAN'T SAY THAT ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY FOUND A PIECE FLOATING OUTSIDE OF MY URETHRA THAT THEY HAD TO REMOVE. THIS HAS RUINED MY LIFE BUT HAS DESTROYED MY FAMILY. THIS STARTED BECAUSE MY BLADDER WAS PROTRUDING OUT OF MY VAGINA, AND I WAS TOLD THAT PLACING A SLING INSIDE ME WOULD LIFT UP MY BLADDER AND IT WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM. I ALSO HAD LIGHT INCONTINENCE WHICH NOW I WEAR DEPENDS AND PADS INSIDE ALL THROUGHOUT EVERY SINGLE DAY WHILE DEALING WITH PAIN THAT IS HEARTLESS TO ME IT'S HOST. I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MY DAY IN COURT FOR VERY LONG TIME. IF I HAD KNOWN BACK THEN EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE LEARNED MYSELF SINCE THEN - PRODUCT BEING MADE OF POLY PROPYLENE PLASTIC THE SAME PLASTIC THAT MAKES LACROSSE STICK NETS, THAT IT DEGRADES CONTRACTS I NEVER WOULD'VE MADE THAT DECISION TO AGREE TO THIS IMPLANT INITIALLY. THE MESH ACTUALLY TWISTED MY COLON. I ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT OR NOT WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE AN MRI DONE OF MY PUDENDAL NERVE WHERE IT WAS CAUGHT IN THE SCAN THAT THERE WAS PROOF OF THE PUDENDAL NERVE DAMAGE. I'VE WAS WRITING A JOURNAL FOR OVER 10 YEARS. I HAVE SO MANY SURGICAL PICTURES OF THE MESS, I HAVE X-RAYS PHOTOS OF WHAT MY BODY LOOK LIKE AFTER HAVING TO TRY TO DO YET ANOTHER MASS REMOVAL. I'VE KEPT IT ALL HOPING THAT SOMEDAY IT COULD BE USED TO HELP ALL THE OTHER WOMEN OUT THERE. IF SOMEONE REALLY DOES WANT TO TALK TO ME, I WOULD LOVE TO TRY TO HELP. THERE ARE TOO MANY TESTS, SURGERIES, I HAVE TRIED SO MANY MEDICATION'S AND FOUND TO BE ALLERGIC TO SO MANY. I'VE TRIED STIMULATOR IS IMPLANTED THAT FAILED BECAUSE THEY CAUSED MORE PAIN ON TOP OF THAT I WAS DEALING WITH ALREADY. SURGICAL REPORTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY SCARY TO READ AT LEAST FOR ME IT WAS.
